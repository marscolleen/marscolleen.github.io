        <p>What most men don’t realize when they get married…they usually live together with this woman.</p>
<p>Living with a woman together…in ONE apartment…that means, the woman is always theere…and she doesn’t go away. She STAYS.</p>
<p>And then she notices EVERYTHING you do…EVERYTHING…for example, she notices if you’re chewing with your mouth open…and she also hears about everything…EVERYTHING!…you can’t do no nothing about that, she actually puts attention into it, how you behave and what you do with your life.</p>
<p>“Did you notice that every time you call your mom, the tone of your voice completely changes? Can you even notice it?”</p>
<p>“Nah.”</p>
<p>“BUT I DID!…And your mom is always right. When I say the exact same thing, I’m never right, your mom is always right. Can you even notice that?”</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“But I DID!”</p>
<p>Straight madness…Just imagine this:</p>
<p>You, a man, come back home. Tired, tortured and exploited from work, and your wife is already there…She wait…Now she wants to talk!</p>
<p>But the man wants to live! He just wants to exist!</p>
<p>Or we switch it up…A nice chap like you back home from work, already chilled for an hour, and then his wife comes, also from work, maybe also tired, tortured and exploited, and she also wants to have her peace of mind…And she just comes in!</p>
<p>She has A KEY!…She’s allowed to do that, it is legal through and through. She comes in…She doesn’t use the doorbell so you have time to say:”You’re not welcome, come back next March.” Nope, not a chance!</p>
<p>And also every shortcoming, every mistake and every kink that you’ve accumulated during your single life…</p>
<p>Those? She’s gonna see it all.</p>
<p>A friend of mine likes to stuff his worn socks in his pillow. Yes, he sleeps with his head on the worn socks. I’ll say it like this: Because of that, his success chance with relationships drastically shrunk. Most women are out the door within ten minutes…they often lead to “half-night-stands”, if there even is one.</p>
<p>I also have a quantity of quirks, I’ll only say one here: My beloved Carrera cars. I built it in the hallway, track length: 16 meter 30. With two bridges. If you wanna play a round with me, feel free to come over.</p>
<p>But you know what? It doesn’t bother Ricarda at all. That’s what I find fascinating with this woman, she goes around it without a problem, she’s totally fine with it, she tolerates, that’s what I love about her.</p>
<p>Then I thought: It’s great that Ricarda doesn’t mind it at all, my other shortcomings, mistakes and kinks, it doesn’t bother her whatsoever. This is what I love about her, but at the same time I got a panic attack: If all that doesn’t bother her, what sort of quirks does she have herself that I know absolutely nothing about?</p>
