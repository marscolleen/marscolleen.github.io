        <p>Almost every kid would beg their parents for a pet sonner or later. But the raising of a pet should be carefully considered. Animals aren’t just toys that can be thrown carelessly to a corner after a short period of time, they are a serious, mostly year-long task.</p>
<h3 id="How-important-are-pets-for-a-child"><a href="#How-important-are-pets-for-a-child" class="headerlink" title="How important are pets for a child?"></a>How important are pets for a child?</h3><p>“Kids growing up with a pet are often more positive in their characteristic development than those who don’t!” Professor Rehinhold Bergler, responsible for a research on pets in Hamburg, says. Other than that, Professor R.Poresky from the University of Kansas argues: “Children that are raised with a pet are smarter than those without pets!” They will be more active, worry less about loneliness or isolation and learn to take responsibility. Kids with problemes will, in most cases, turn quieter and more balanced. So some who spend a lot of time in front of computers might just turn into a nature lover through walking and fumbling around with their dog. For children in the city, pets are their only connection with nature and the animal world. Kids learn to respond to the pets’ needs and therefore improve their social competence, which eventually benefits them in the society.</p>
<h3 id="From-when-can-a-child-independently-care-for-a-pet"><a href="#From-when-can-a-child-independently-care-for-a-pet" class="headerlink" title="From when can a child independently care for a pet?"></a>From when can a child independently care for a pet?</h3><p>Dr. Kernstock, vet from Vienna: “There’s no exact number as to when you can trust a kid with an animal. It all comes down to the character and the maturity of the kid. But it’s no question that a child in kindergarten needs support from their parents if they want a pet. But they need to know that it’s necessary for them to take on duty upon raising an animal. The kid has to learn from the very get-go, that they have to treat this pet with love and care. The sense of responsibility within a child develops slowly, but at around 8 years of age, kids should be capable of doing most of the work on their own, but if they opt for a dog or a cat, they should be at least 12 years old.”</p>
<h3 id="Which-type-of-pet-is-the-best-for-children"><a href="#Which-type-of-pet-is-the-best-for-children" class="headerlink" title="Which type of pet is the best for children?"></a>Which type of pet is the best for children?</h3><p>Dr. Kernstock: “Many parents tend to see the first pet as a ‘test sample’, usually a small animal. They don’t cost much, and they are relatively simple to raise! But I strongly oppose this opinion. Small animals, for example a hamster, a guinea pig, or a bunny, are night animals, and they mostly just sleep under the daylight and want to have their peace of mind. They are definitely not toys that you can pick and touch. But dogs and cats are much better options, even with younger children. We tend to feel a lot more connected with them on a longer basis.”</p>
<h3 id="Dog-or-cat"><a href="#Dog-or-cat" class="headerlink" title="Dog or cat?"></a>Dog or cat?</h3><p>Dr. Kernstock: “Cats aren’t that attracted to human beings as dogs. They like being alone, while dogs tend to seek attention from people.”</p>
<h3 id="Is-it-dangerous-animals-and-babies"><a href="#Is-it-dangerous-animals-and-babies" class="headerlink" title="Is it dangerous - animals and babies?"></a>Is it dangerous - animals and babies?</h3><p>Dr. Kernstock: “That depends on the characteristic of the pet, how easy it can be for the creature to turn jealous. If you come home with the baby, and the animal integrates from the start, then it’s normally no probleme. That means, the pet wouldn’t be a threat to the baby. But you should never leave a pet with the baby alone. The baby can get very active, and it might trigger the animal into defending itself! Kids should also learn that sleeping or eating animals are dangerous!”</p>
