        <h3 id="3"><a href="#3" class="headerlink" title="3"></a>3</h3><p>You have to admit, you can say a lot about hospitals, but you can’t say it’s not nice in there. I always liked staying in hospitals. You do nothing for the whole day, and then the nurses come. They are all super young and super friendly. And they wear this short, white overall, which I find great, because you can just see what underwear they have on. Why I find that good, I don’t have a single idea. Because, if someone were running on the streets with this white overall on, I would say it’s just foolish. But when it’s in a hospital, it’s cool. Only my opinion. It’s kinda like in a mafia film, where one of the gangsters always keeps quiet for a minute before they answer. “Hey!” A minute of silence. “Look at me in the eyes!” Five minutes of silence. In real life, it’s just weird, but not in a mafia.</p>
<p>My favorite nurse is Hanna, she comes from Libanon. She has short dark hair and wears <em>normal</em> underwear. And that’s also great: normal underwear. Other ones often look a little bit sad. When you don’t have the figure of Megan Fox, it can look a little despairing. I don’t know, maybe I’m a pervert: I like <em>normal</em> underwear.</p>
<p>Hanna is actually only a nurse student, that means she’s an intern or something, and when she enters my room, she always knocks the door with two fingers at first, which I find very, very polite, and she makes up a new name for me every day. At first, I was Maik, then Maiki, then Maikipaiki, at some time, I already started thinking: old pie. But that wasn’t the end. Then I was called Michael Schumacher, then Attila the King of the Huns, then pigkiller and finally the sick rabbit. I would stay at this hospital for another year just for that.</p>
<p>Hanna changes my dressing daily. That hurts a lot, it also hurts Hanna, you can see it from her face.</p>
<p>“The main thing is for you to have fun.” she always says that when she’s finished, and then I would say that I’m gonna somehow marry her later or something like that. But unfortunately, she already has a boyfriend. Sometimes, she just comes and sits at my bed, because without those I get practically no visits, and it’s really a leisure activity that we do. A real adult activity. It’s always easier to talk with women like Hanna than girls my age. If someone can explain why, please call me, because I don’t get it.</p>
