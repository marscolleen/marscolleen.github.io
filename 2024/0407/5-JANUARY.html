        <h3 id="Wednesday"><a href="#Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>Now I know what I can do with the Big Wheel that Rupert gave me for Christmas. I created a game where someone drives around and the other tries to hit them with a football.</p>
<p>First was Rupert the Driver and I the thrower.</p>
<p>It’s a lot harder than I thought to meet the goal. Other than that, I didn’t have much time to practice. After every start, it took Rupert about ten minutes to get back on track.</p>
<p>Rupert wanted to switch constantly and let me also try the car. But I’m not interested. The thing went down hill in about fifty parts and there were no brakes!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-07_210858.png"></p>
<p><em>You don’t wanna try it?</em></p>
<p><em>No thanks…You can do it a lot better!</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I didn’t succeed in getting Rupert off the Big Wheel for a single time today. But at least I had something to do for the rest of the Christmas break.</p>
<h3 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>I wanted to go to Rupert’s today to play the Big-Wheel-game again, but mom said that I had to write my Christmas gratitude letters first before I could go anywhere.</p>
<p>I thought that I’m gonna finish it easily in half an hour, but when it came to the actual writing, there was nothing in my brain.</p>
<p>It’s really not easy to show gratitude for things you don’t want at all.</p>
<p>I started with the people that didn’t give me a sweater, because I thought those would be easier. But after two or three letters I gave up and decided that I’m gonna write more or less every time.</p>
<p>So I found a pre-made letter form online and left spaces for the necessary changes. And then it became a lot easier.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-07_212203.png"></p>
<p><em>Dear Aunt Lydia,</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you so much for the great lexicon!</em></p>
<p><em>How did you know I wanted that for Christmas?</em></p>
<p><em>The lexicon looks great on my bookshelf!</em></p>
<p><em>My friends would definitely envy me, when I have my own lexicon.</em></p>
<p><em>I hope you have the best Christmas ever!</em></p>
<p><em>Your Greg</em></p>
<p>It worked great for the first few gifts, but as I went on, it got off track a bit.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-18_210403.png"></p>
<p><em>Dear Aunt Loretta,</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you so much for the great pants!</em></p>
<p><em>How did you know I wanted that for Christmas?</em></p>
<p><em>The pants looks great in my legs!</em></p>
<p><em>My friends would definitely envy me, when I have my own pants.</em></p>
<p><em>I hope you have the best Christmas ever!</em></p>
<p><em>Your Greg</em></p>
<h3 id="Friday"><a href="#Friday" class="headerlink" title="Friday"></a>Friday</h3><p>Today, I finally managed to hit Robert on the Big Wheel, but from then it didn’t go as I thought. I wanted to hit him in the shoulder, but I wasn’t accurate enough and the football ended up landing under the tricycle.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-18_210914.png"></p>
<h3 id="Monday"><a href="#Monday" class="headerlink" title="Monday"></a>Monday</h3><p>The Christmas holidays are gone and school officially starts today. Are you still worrying about Rupert and the tricycle accident? He broke his hand. And now he’s wearing a cast. And today everyone was around him, like he’s a hero or something.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-20_153539.png"></p>
<p><em>Does it still hurt?</em></p>
<p><em>Well, a bit.</em></p>
<p><em>You poor little thing!</em></p>
<p>I tried to steal Rupert’s show, but it worked the opposite way.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-20_153824.png"></p>
<p><em>I’m the one that broke his arm!</em></p>
<p><em>You devil!</em></p>
<p>At lunch, a couple of girls invited Rupert to their desks, to FEED him.</p>
<p>What annoyed me the most, was that Rupert is a right-hander and broke his LEFT hand! He can feed himself no problem.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-20_155135.png"></p>
<p><em>Here comes the plane!</em></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday"><a href="#Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Rupert’s arm inspired me. I thought, I needed one of those myself.</p>
<p>I found some rubbish bags at home and wrapped my hand with them.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize that the girls wouldn’t treat me like Rupert, but then I understood the situation.</p>
<p>If you have an actual cast, everyone would want to write their name on it. But a marker doesn’t work too good on a plastic bag.</p>
<p>So I found another solution to the problem, and, to be honest, it worked great!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-25_133729.png"></p>
<p><em>Do you want to be the first to sign?</em></p>
<p>But that went down the drain. My arm attracted some people and they wanted to examine it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-25_133921.png"></p>
<p><em>Can I see your arm?</em></p>
<p><em>Stop right there.</em></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday-1"><a href="#Tuesday-1" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Last weak the new semester started, so now we have some new subjects. One of which was “unconstant group work”.</p>
<p>I WANTED to join group 2, because I was already doing great in group 1.</p>
<p>But as a boy, being able to sew doesn’t get you a whole lot of popularity.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-25_134217.png"></p>
<p><em>Look! Gref has a purse!</em></p>
<p><em>That’s a self-made book bag.</em></p>
<p><em>Fine, still a purse.</em></p>
<p>This subject was an experiment, and they’re trying it out in our school for the first time.</p>
<p>The idea is that every class gets a project and we work on it in groups without teachers for the whole semester.</p>
<p>The flaw in the plan is that everyone in the group gets the same grade at the end. When I was told that Ricky Fischer was in my group, I knew it was trouble.</p>
<p>Ricky is mainly known for the things he do, such as collecting old gum stuck under his desk and eating them mindlesly. So I definitely am not expecting anything high for our group.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-25_134641.png"></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday-2"><a href="#Tuesday-2" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Today, we got the task for our group project, and guess what it is? We’re supposed to build a robot! At first, everyone was overwhelmed, because we thought, we had to make an actual robot all by ourselves.</p>
<p>But Mr. Darnell explained to us that we don’t have build real ones. We only have to design the appearance and the functions.</p>
<p>Then he went out of the classroom and we were on our own. We started by collecting some ideas. I wrote the suggestions on the board.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-29_210712.png"></p>
<p><em>The robot should: do homework do the dishes make breakfast brush teeth</em></p>
<p>The others were impressed by my ideas, but it wasn’t hard at all. I just wrote all the stuff I didn’t like to do.</p>
<p>Then a few girls went up and wrote their own ideas. They wiped mine and wrote theirs instead.</p>
<p>They wanted a robot that can give out fashion tips and has ten different shades of lip gloss for the ten fingers.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-29_210934.png"></p>
<p>We boys thought that was the worst idea of all times. So we divided ourselves into two groups: boys and girls. The boys went to the other side of the classroom, when the girls stood still and chatted.</p>
<p>Now that we had the people who seriously wanted to work, we started. Someone suggested that the robot should be able to repeat any name told to it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-29_211341.png"></p>
<p><em>Hello, BOB. It’s nice to meet you, BOB.</em></p>
<p>But then someone said, you shouldn’t use swear words as names, because the robot isn’t allowed to swear. So we decided to make a list of the swear words that the robot shouldn’t be able to use.</p>
<p>We wrote out all the normal ones, but then Ricky Fischer somehow knew twenty more which none of us have ever heard before.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-29_211623.png"></p>
<p>So, Ricky was the most worthy participant of the project in the end.</p>
<p>Before long, Mr. Darnell came back to see how we were going. He found our list and looked through.</p>
<p>To make things short, there won’t be any “unconstant group work” for this semester.</p>
<p>At least not for us boys. If all the robots have lip-glosses as fingers in the future, you’ll know how it came to that.</p>
<h3 id="Thursday-1"><a href="#Thursday-1" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>Today, there was a school meeting to watch the movie “I think I’m great!”. We watch it every single year.</p>
<p>The movie basically tells you that you should be satisfied with who you are and you shouldn’t try to deliberately change yourself.</p>
<p>To be honest, I think it’s totally wrong for kids, especially for my school.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_152808.png"></p>
<p>Then they said that they were looking for student guides. That got me an idea.</p>
<p>If someone gets into a fight with a student guide, they could end up being expelled. The way I see it, a little extra security doesn’t do any harm.</p>
<p>Other than that, I think a bit of authority could do me good.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_153258.png"></p>
<p><em>Could we please cross the street now?</em></p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p><em>But we’ve been standing here for an hour!</em></p>
<p>So I went to Mr. Winter’s office and applied for the job, and I also talked Rupert into it. I thought, we had to do high knees or push-ups or something to get the job, but he just gave us the badges and the ribbons.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_153544.png"></p>
<p>Then he said, there was a special order for us. Next to our school, there’s a primary school and for some reason there’s a bunch of kindergarten kids in there.</p>
<p>Mr. Winter wants us to escort the kids home at noon. I caught the meaning immediately: we could skip twenty minutes of math! Rupert wanted to say something, but I stomped his feet under the desk like crazy before he could finish his sentence.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_153905.png"></p>
<p><em>But then we’re gonna miss OOOUUUCH!</em></p>
<p>I couldn’t believe my luck. I got extra protection and an excuse to skip a half of my math session, without having to do anything!</p>
<h3 id="Tuesday-3"><a href="#Tuesday-3" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Today was our first day as student guides. I and Rupert didn’t have specific positions like the others, so we didn’t have to stand in the cold for a whole hour.</p>
<p>But we still picked up some hot kakao, which were distributed to all the student guides before the first session.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_154549.png"></p>
<p>What’s more: we could go to the first period ten minutes later.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_155015.png"></p>
<p>This school guide thing is really sick!</p>
<p>At 12:15, I left class with Rupert to guide the kindergarten kids to home. The whole thing took three quarters, and when we returned, there’s only 20 minutes math left.</p>
<p>Guiding the kids back home was no problem. But one of them started to sniff all weird midway, and I knew right away that something happened.</p>
<p>He wanted to say something, but I just didn’t pay attention to him and went on. I only bring them home, but I’m not responsible for anything else! No way!</p>
