        <h3 id="Wednesday"><a href="#Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>Now I know what I can do with the Big Wheel that Rupert gave me for Christmas. I created a game where someone drives around and the other tries to hit them with a football.</p>
<p>First was Rupert the Driver and I the thrower.</p>
<p>It’s a lot harder than I thought to meet the goal. Other than that, I didn’t have much time to practice. After every start, it took Rupert about ten minutes to get back on track.</p>
<p>Rupert wanted to switch constantly and let me also try the car. But I’m not interested. The thing went down hill in about fifty parts and there were no brakes!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-07_210858.png"></p>
<p><em>You don’t wanna try it?</em></p>
<p><em>No thanks…You can do it a lot better!</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I didn’t succeed in getting Rupert off the Big Wheel for a single time today. But at least I had something to do for the rest of the Christmas break.</p>
<h3 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>I wanted to go to Rupert’s today to play the Big-Wheel-game again, but mom said that I had to write my Christmas gratitude letters first before I could go anywhere.</p>
<p>I thought that I’m gonna finish it easily in half an hour, but when it came to the actual writing, there was nothing in my brain.</p>
<p>It’s really not easy to show gratitude for things you don’t want at all.</p>
<p>I started with the people that didn’t give me a sweater, because I thought those would be easier. But after two or three letters I gave up and decided that I’m gonna write more or less every time.</p>
<p>So I found a pre-made letter form online and left spaces for the necessary changes. And then it became a lot easier.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-07_212203.png"></p>
<p><em>Dear Aunt Lydia,</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you so much for the great lexicon!</em></p>
<p><em>How did you know I wanted that for Christmas?</em></p>
<p><em>The lexicon looks great on my bookshelf!</em></p>
<p><em>My friends would definitely envy me, when I have my own lexicon.</em></p>
<p><em>I hope you have the best Christmas ever!</em></p>
<p><em>Your Greg</em></p>
<p>It worked great for the first few gifts, but as I went on, it got off track a bit.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-18_210403.png"></p>
<p><em>Dear Aunt Loretta,</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you so much for the great pants!</em></p>
<p><em>How did you know I wanted that for Christmas?</em></p>
<p><em>The pants looks great in my legs!</em></p>
<p><em>My friends would definitely envy me, when I have my own pants.</em></p>
<p><em>I hope you have the best Christmas ever!</em></p>
<p><em>Your Greg</em></p>
<h3 id="Friday"><a href="#Friday" class="headerlink" title="Friday"></a>Friday</h3><p>Today, I finally managed to hit Robert on the Big Wheel, but from then it didn’t go as I thought. I wanted to hit him in the shoulder, but I wasn’t accurate enough and the football ended up landing under the tricycle.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-18_210914.png"></p>
<h3 id="Monday"><a href="#Monday" class="headerlink" title="Monday"></a>Monday</h3><p>The Christmas holidays are gone and school officially starts today. Are you still worrying about Rupert and the tricycle accident? He broke his hand. And now he’s wearing a cast. And today everyone was around him, like he’s a hero or something.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-20_153539.png"></p>
<p><em>Does it still hurt?</em></p>
<p><em>Well, a bit.</em></p>
<p><em>You poor little thing!</em></p>
<p>I tried to steal Rupert’s show, but it worked the opposite way.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-20_153824.png"></p>
<p><em>I’m the one that broke his arm!</em></p>
<p><em>You devil!</em></p>
<p>At lunch, a couple of girls invited Rupert to their desks, to FEED him.</p>
<p>What annoyed me the most, was that Rupert is a right-hander and broke his LEFT hand! He can feed himself no problem.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-20_155135.png"></p>
<p><em>Here comes the plane!</em></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday"><a href="#Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Rupert’s arm inspired me. I thought, I needed one of those myself.</p>
<p>I found some rubbish bags at home and wrapped my hand with them.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize that the girls wouldn’t treat me like Rupert, but then I understood the situation.</p>
<p>If you have an actual cast, everyone would want to write their name on it. But a marker doesn’t work too good on a plastic bag.</p>
<p>So I found another solution to the problem, and, to be honest, it worked great!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-25_133729.png"></p>
<p><em>Do you want to be the first to sign?</em></p>
<p>But that went down the drain. My arm attracted some people and they wanted to examine it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-25_133921.png"></p>
<p><em>Can I see your arm?</em></p>
<p><em>Stop right there.</em></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday-1"><a href="#Tuesday-1" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Last weak the new semester started, so now we have some new subjects. One of which was “unconstant group work”.</p>
<p>I WANTED to join group 2, because I was already doing great in group 1.</p>
<p>But as a boy, being able to sew doesn’t get you a whole lot of popularity.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-25_134217.png"></p>
<p><em>Look! Gref has a purse!</em></p>
<p><em>That’s a self-made book bag.</em></p>
<p><em>Fine, still a purse.</em></p>
<p>This subject was an experiment, and they’re trying it out in our school for the first time.</p>
<p>The idea is that every class gets a project and we work on it in groups without teachers for the whole semester.</p>
<p>The flaw in the plan is that everyone in the group gets the same grade at the end. When I was told that Ricky Fischer was in my group, I knew it was trouble.</p>
<p>Ricky is mainly known for the things he do, such as collecting old gum stuck under his desk and eating them mindlesly. So I definitely am not expecting anything high for our group.</p>
