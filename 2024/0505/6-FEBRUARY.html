        <h3 id="Wednesday"><a href="#Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>Today, it snowed for the first time this year and school was closed. We originally had a math test, but with the whole school guide thing, I’ve been slacking off a bit. So I was extremely happy.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-05_142919.png"></p>
<p>I called Rupert and told him to come. We’ve been wanting to build the biggest snowman in the world for a couple few years.</p>
<p>And when I say the biggest snowman in the world, I mean the it. We want it to be in the Guinness records.</p>
<p>But every time we wanted to start the project, the snow starts melting, and winter is officially gone. This year is the perfect chance.</p>
<p>We began as soon as Rupert arrived by rolling out some balls. In my plan, the balls should be at least three meters high, if we actually want to break the world record. But they are turn heavier as we keep rolling. And we have to take a break now and then.</p>
<p>When we were pausing, mom came outside and wanted drive to the supermarket, but our snowball was in the way. So she did us a favor.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-05_143812.png"></p>
<p><em>Ach! It’s heavy!</em></p>
<p>After the break we went on with the rolling, until we were unable to make the balls any bigger. Then we carefully observed our piece of work for the first time, and saw, what a catastrophe we’ve created.</p>
<p>The snowball was so heavy, dad’s garden, which he planted last autumn, stuck onto it.</p>
<p>I hoped for a few more centimeters of snow to cover up the scene of the crime, but the snow suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Our plan the build the largest snowman in the world is starting to fall apart. But I thought of a better plan for the snowballs.</p>
<p>When it snows, the kids always comes onto Whirley Street to snowboard.</p>
<p>That means, tomorrow, when the kids come out again, I and Rupert will teach them a lesson.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-13_203207.png"></p>
<h3 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>When I waked up today, the snow had already started to melt. So I called Rupert and said that he should come straight to me.</p>
<p>When I was waiting for Rupert, I watched Manni trying to build a snowman out of the few bits of pieces we left when we were rolling our giant snowball.</p>
<p>It was really a tragic play.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-13_203541.png"></p>
<p>I can’t think of anything more unlucky than dad looking out of the window right that moment.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-13_203636.png"></p>
<p>Dad was ALREADY a bit angry at me, because I ruined his lawn, so I knew right then: angry he is! I heard the garage door go up. Dad came, armed with a snow shovel, and I was thinking, I should find a better place for my grave than this.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-13_204227.png"></p>
<p>But dad didn’t come towards me, but toward my snowball. And in less than a minute, my work turned to nothing.</p>
<p>In a few minutes, Rupert came. I thought, maybe he would think it’s funny.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-13_204349.png"></p>
<p>But he was really excited about rolling the thing down the street, because he suddenly turned sour. And the unbelievable happened: Rupert was angry to ME, because of something MY DAD did.</p>
<p>If my teacher, Mrs. Levine was there, she would probably say that the whole thing had an “ironic” touch.</p>
