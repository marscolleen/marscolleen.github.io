        <h3 id="Flyers"><a href="#Flyers" class="headerlink" title="Flyers"></a>Flyers</h3><p>By dawn, they were raining from the sky. They glided across the fortification wall, twirled over the roofs and fluttered in the gaps between the houses. The whole street was filled with them, they painted the cobble road white. <em>An urgent message to the citizens of this city</em>, On it said. <em>Please leave any open land at once</em>.</p>
<p>The tide rose. The moon, small, golden, hanged in the sky. Over the roofs of the beach hotel in the east and in the garden behind it, half a dozen American units were loading their planes with grenades and mortars.</p>
<h3 id="Bombs"><a href="#Bombs" class="headerlink" title="Bombs"></a>Bombs</h3><p>They crossed the canal at midnight. It was twelve, and they started naming songs: <em>Stardust</em> and <em>Stormy Weather</em>, <em>In the Mood</em> and <em>Pistol-Packin’ Mama</em>. The sea was getting deeper under them, with bits of white crests floating. Soon could the navigators draw out the flat, moon-lit outlines of different islands.</p>
<p>France.</p>
<p>Radios were rustling. The bombers drop slowly, almost gently from above. Red lights ascent from the antiaircrafts along the coast. Dark shipwrecks suddenly appeared, sank or destroyed, a few with separate pieces, another flickering with fire. On another side of the coast, scared sheep were running between rocks.</p>
<p>In every aircraft sat a bombardier, who looks through the scope and counts to twenty. Four, five, six, seven. For the bombardiers, the approaching and unguarded city on their granite headland looked like a scary tooth, black and dangerous, a last abscess, that had to be cut.</p>
<h3 id="The-Girl"><a href="#The-Girl" class="headerlink" title="The Girl"></a>The Girl</h3><p>In a corner of the city, in a tall, narrow how with the number 4 in Rue Vauborel, the blind, aged sixteen girl Marie-Laure LeBlanc kneeled on the fifth and highest floor next to a table that is occupied with a model. It’s a model of the city, with scaled replications of houses, shops and hotels inside the city wall. Here is the cathedral with the tower, there the massive, old chateau of Saint-Malo, and all around the model, she was counting the number of houses near the sea with their chimneys. A narrow, wooden bridge went from the Plage du Mole in the water, a delicate, net-like roof arched over the fish market.</p>
<p>Marie-Laure went through the centimeter-wide railing above the wall with her fingers. </p>
