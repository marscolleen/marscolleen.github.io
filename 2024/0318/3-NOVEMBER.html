        <h3 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>Today, we went by grandma’s house with the school bus. Someone covered it with toilet paper last night, I wasn’t really surprised about it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_203315.png"></p>
<p>Somehow I felt sorry, because it’s definitely gonna take a long time to clean it up. On the other hand, grandma definitely hasn’t experienced anything like this as a retiree.</p>
<h3 id="Wednesday"><a href="#Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>In the third hour, our PE teacher Mr. Underwood announced that the boys are going to learn wrestling for the next six weeks.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing boys at my school are good at, it’s wrestling. Mr. Underwood kinda threw a bomb into the crowd there.</p>
<p>After PE we had recess and the cafeteria was a pure madhouse.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_203645.png"></p>
<p>No idea how the school thought when they decided to teach wrestling.</p>
<p>I’ve decided that if I don’t want to get slammed in the next one-and-a-half month, I should finish my homework better, especially anything regarding wrestling.</p>
<p>So I lent two wrestling video games and wanted to learn a few tricks. After a few moments, I think I’ve got it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_204215.png"></p>
<p><em>Does that feel rightt?</em></p>
<p><em>YES! NO! HELP!</em></p>
<p>The other boys in my class should be more careful, because if this goes on, I can be really dangerous.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_204643.png"></p>
<p>On the other hand, I don’t want to be TOO good. A boy called Andy Loch was sporter of the month for once, because he played best in the basketball tournament, and they hung up his picture in the corridors.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_204817.png"></p>
<p>It took them about five seconds to check how “A. Loch” sounds when someone says it loud, and that was it for Andy.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_204915.png"></p>
<h3 id="Thursday-1"><a href="#Thursday-1" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>Today I realized that the type of wrestling Mr. Underwood talked about is TOTALLY different from the one in the TV.</p>
<p>First, you had to put on a thing called “jumpsuit”, which looked incredibly similar to the typical 1800s swimwear.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_205138.png"></p>
<p>There weren’t any rings with lines on the edge. Essentially, it was just a sweaty mat that looked ancient, as if it had been used for a long time.</p>
<p>The hour began with Mr. Underwood trying to find a volunteer to demonstrate a few moves. There’s no chance I’m going!</p>
<p>I and Rupert wanted to hide behind the curtains on the other side of the stadium, but the girls immediately found us.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_205434.png"></p>
<p>We got out quickly and joined the other boys.</p>
<p>Mr. Underwood chose me of course, somehow because I’m the skinniest in the class. So he could easily throw me without tiring himself. He showed the other boys some moves that had weird names, like “axle throw”, “singing handle” or “leg wrenches”.</p>
<p>When he was showing us a move called “firefighter”, I farted slightly. And then I knew it, my jumpsuit wasn’t really tight.</p>
<p>At that moment, I was so glad that the girls were on the OTHER side of the stadium.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_210053.png"></p>
<p>Mr. Underwood sorted us into weight groups. I felt really happy about that, because that meant I didn’t have to go against people who weighed 110 kilograms like Benny Wells.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-19_212930.png"></p>
<p>But then, when I knew who I was facing, I really wanted to switch for Benny Wells.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-19_213028.png"></p>
<p><em>Your partner would be Finley, Greg.</em></p>
<p>Finley was the only one in my weight group. And apparently he really paid attention when Mr. Underwood showed the moves. Because he wrecked me from every single side. For the whole hour, I REALLY got to know Finley.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-19_213228.png"></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday"><a href="#Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>All the wrestling classes really put our school upside-down. Now, the boys are wrestling in the classrooms, simply everywhere! But the first quarter of recess is the worst.</p>
<p>You can’t go two meters without seeing someone wrestling. I simply tried to avoid them. Because I swear to you, if it goes on like this, one of them will directly roll into the stinky cheese, and then everything with the cheese finger will continue.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_133020.png"></p>
<p>My other problem is that I have to wrestle with Finley every single day. But I thought of something this morning. When I enter a higher weight class, I don’t have to face Finley anymore.</p>
<p>So I stuffed my hoodie with every sock and shirt that I have, to try and get into a higher weight class.</p>
<p>But I was still too thin.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_133308.png"></p>
<p>That means, I had to really get heavier. At first I thought I would just drench myself with fast food, but then a much better idea came up.</p>
<p>I wanted MUSCLES, not fat.</p>
<p>I wasn’t really interested in getting fit, but all the wrestling business got me thinking about it.</p>
<p>If I exercise regularly now, maybe that’ll come in handy later on.</p>
<p>Because we’ll be playing football in PE in spring. And we are sorted into “shirts” and “naked-top” teams. And somehow, I ALWAYS lands in “naked-top”.</p>
<p>I think they do this just to see the unfit boys get embarassed about themselves.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_133807.png"></p>
<p>But if I could manage to grow muscles, things are definitely going to change in April.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_133858.png"></p>
<p><em>Greg Heffley, you’re playing in shirts.</em></p>
<p>Today I told mom and dad my plan after dinner. I said that I’ll be needing a few weights and equipments.</p>
<p>I showed them a magazine I bought, just to let them know how fit I wanted to go for.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_134058.png"></p>
<p>At first, mom didn’t say much about it, but dad found it great. I think he was just happy that my views have changed:</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_134155.png"></p>
<p><em>If you train, you’ll grow muscles!</em></p>
<p><em>Muscles are so awful!</em></p>
<p>but mom said, if I want to have barbells, I have to first prove that I can stand a full training program. She said I should do squats and push-ups for two weeks.</p>
<p>I tried to tell her that if you wanted to grow actual muscles, you have to use the high-tech equipments that gyms provided. But mom clearly didn’t want to know anything about that.</p>
<p>Dad said if I wanted a barbell, I should just wait until Christmas.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_134737.png"></p>
<p>But there’s still one-and-a-half months till Christmas, and if I face Finley again in PE, I’m gonna throw a fit.</p>
<p>Mom and dad are obviously no help at this point. So I’ll have to take matters into my own hands.</p>
<h3 id="Saturday"><a href="#Saturday" class="headerlink" title="Saturday"></a>Saturday</h3><p>I can’t wait to start with my body-building-program today. Even if mom didn’t want to buy the equipments, we could still somehow make it work.</p>
<p>so I looked in our fridge and emptied the two big buckets of milk and juice and filled them with sand. Then I taped them to a stick and there it is, my barbell!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-23_150622.png"></p>
<p>Then I got an ironing board and a few boxes and handcrafted a bench. And now, the program can start.</p>
<p>But I needed a training partner, so I called Rupert. But when he appeared in front of the door with this fully feminine sport suit, I immediately knew it was a grave mistake to call him over.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-23_151121.png"></p>
<p>I let Rupert try out the bench first, because I wanted to know if it could withstand the weight.</p>
<p>After about five minutes he wanted to quit, but I wasn’t gonna let that happen. And that’s when the training partner come in: to cheer one to their goal!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-23_151446.png"></p>
<p><em>Fifteen to go! Start!</em></p>
<p>I knew that Rupert wasn’t gonna take the whole thing as seriously as me, so I’m testing his endurance.</p>
<p>In the middle of his training session, I went and put on a fake mustache Rodrick used for his play.</p>
<p>And when Rupert was trying to lift upwards, I went into his view.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-23_152225.png"></p>
