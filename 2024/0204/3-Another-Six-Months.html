        <p><em>After the high school graduation exam, Sophie is going to university. But first, she must do mandatory labor for six months. All young Germans must go there. They must help in the countryside or the building of infastructures. The young men are already arriving at the frontlines, where they will do military work.</em></p>
<p>The disciplines are strict. Everyone gets a uniform and a bed in a big hall. They are not allowed to bring books. Every morning, there is a roll call and in the evening a teacher will come, who teaches them the philosophy of life.</p>
<p>Sophie’s group is working in the countryside. The work is tough.</p>
<p>“Think about your fathers and brothers out there on the frontlines! Every German woman must do what she can! You are working for our nation!” Sophie must recite the propaganda of the Nazis several times every day. She doesn’t like to chat with other girls. They don’t understand her.</p>
<p>One morning, when they were making their beds, the other girls were quicker.</p>
<p>Gerda was standing next to her.</p>
<p>“Sophie! Are you still not done? We have to…”</p>
<p>She saw the book that Sophie was holding.</p>
<p>“What do you have there? A book?” She spoke on, but much quieter, “That’s forbidden! What is it then? A romance novel? Can you…”</p>
<p>Sophie didn’t let her rag on.</p>
<p>“No,” She said, “It’s Augustin. Confessions.”</p>
<p>“Augu…what? Isn’t that a saint? You’re definitely a weirdo!”</p>
<p>Sophie just put the book back under the mattress.</p>
<p>Gerda already ran to the breakfast room. “Do you know what she’s reading?” Sophie heard others ask. “The sacred Augustin!” Now everyone is laughing.</p>
<p>“Do you want to become a nun?”</p>
<p>“Or a saint?”</p>
<p>Sophie didn’t answer.</p>
<p>Six months are long, when one feels so alone, but just isn’t.</p>
<p>The girls only have a little free time on weekends.</p>
<p>Others go dancing. Sophie doesn’t, she prefers a walk and some reading.</p>
<p>And this Saturday is the same.</p>
<p>“Sophie, we’re going to the village, to dance! Are you coming along? There are handsome men there!”</p>
<p>“No, I’m tired, I’m staying here!”</p>
<p>“How you like it then!” the others were looking at her. “If you want to be left alone!”</p>
<p>Then they went. Sophie still heard them laughing out loud.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, she’s also ready.</p>
<p>Today when she was working, she saw a small orchestra near here.</p>
<p>She’ll go there.</p>
<p>A small baroque orchestra, standing between two tall trees.</p>
<p>The door is open. Sophie heard an organ playing.</p>
<p>She went in, then up.</p>
<p>In front of the organ sat an old man.</p>
<p>He saw her comming, he looked interested in the book, which she was holding in her hand.</p>
<p>“Augustinus.”, he said and smiled, “without states, there will be no law.”</p>
<p>“And without law no states.” She quoted.</p>
<p>The old man smiled. They understood each other. In this fearful time, it can often happen quickly.</p>
<p>“Can you play?” He asked her.</p>
<p>“Piano, yeah. Am I allowed to try?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I have to go now. You can play. You can come here every evening if you want to. Goodbye.”</p>
<p>“Thank you! Goodbye.”</p>
<p>Sophie sat in front of the organ and tried to play. It was going great.</p>
<p>She sat there for a long time and played. It still went great. Even after months of hard work, Sophie’s fingers were still sharp.</p>
<p>From then on, every free evening she had, she went here and played.</p>
<p>Slowly, her performance improved.</p>
<p>And then, there were only a few weeks left.</p>
<p>But a couple of days, the girls had to attend yet another roll call in the evening.</p>
<p>The commander stood in front of them.</p>
<p>“German girls! Germany needs you! Our men are battling at the front! And you should also play your part. German men and women, together till the end of the war! After the labor, you’ll serve half a year of auxiliary service! You’ll be filled with joy when you help our men during the battles! Our company is going to the east! Hail Hitler!”</p>
<p>“Hail Hitler!” The girls answered.</p>
<p>Then they went into the sleeping hall.</p>
<p>“Another six months!” Some girls were crying. They wanted to go back home.</p>
<p>Others didn’t find it so tragic.</p>
<p>“My boyfriend is in Russia, at the front!” One said, “And he’s not crying. How long he’s going to stay there, nobody knows! And maybe he’s never coming back…”</p>
<p>Others said: “For the commander! For Germany!”</p>
<p>Sophie kept quiet. She couldn’t cry either.</p>
<p>Another six months. But she knew: she’ll manage it.</p>
