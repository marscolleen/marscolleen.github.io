        <h3 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>It’s only a few days till the performance, and I still have no idea how we can make this work.</p>
<p>First, nobody took the actual efforts to learn their roles. And Mrs. Norton is sour about it.</p>
<p>During rehearsal, she’s always hinting the lines.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_144943.png"></p>
<p>Well, I don’t know how it’s gonna work next Tuesday, if Mrs. Norton has to stay ten meters away from the piano.</p>
<p>Other than that, it’s spreading between us that Mrs. Norton is still creating new scenes and figures.</p>
<p>Yesterday, she decided that a first grader will play Dorothy’s dog: Toto. But today, the boy’s mother came and wanted her son upright, because it’s “shameful” to be on all fours.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_145559.png"></p>
<p>Now, we have a dog that’s running on it’s back legs all the time.</p>
<p>But the worst change is that Mrs. Norton composed a song for the TREES. She said that everyone who joined should be “allowed” to sing a song.</p>
<p>So today, we sang the most horrible song of all times for a whole hour.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_145949.png"></p>
<p><em>We are three trees…</em></p>
<p>Thank god Rodrick wasn’t coming to see this absolute catastrophe. Mrs. Norton said, the performance was going to take place in our hall, and I knew, Rodrick would never give up time for a school performance.</p>
<p>But there are good news today. Towards the end of rehearsal, Andy Kelly stomped over Philip James and lost a corner of a tooth, because he couldn’t support his body with his arms.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_150350.png"></p>
<p>The good news is, we’re finally getting armholes in our costumes.</p>
<h3 id="Tuesday"><a href="#Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Today was the great performance of “The Wizard of Oz”! Before it started, there were already a few signs showing that this wasn’t gonna go smooth.</p>
<p>I peeked through the curtains to see how many people were coming and who was there in the first row? My brother Rodrick, even with a tie!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_150921.png"></p>
<p>It was clear then, that I had to sing, and I had to sing with shame. The performance should’ve started at 8, but there was a delay because Philip James suddenly got stage fright.</p>
<p>At first, you would think that when one only needs to quietly sit on the ground and do absolutely nothing, he could hold it for an introduction’s time. But Philip was sweating a whole lot and had to be carried to his parents finally.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_151351.png"></p>
<p>The introduction finally began at half past eight. Just as I said, no one was able to recite their lines, and Mrs. Norton had to run back and forth between the backstage and her piano. The little boy who played Toto needed a stool and a bunch of comic books on the stage, so the part with the dog was totally ruined.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_151836.png"></p>
<p>When the forest scene came, I went into position with the other trees. The curtains went up and right this moment I heard Manni yell.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_152050.png"></p>
<p>Oh, great. I successfully hid this nickname for five years, and now the whole city knows it. I got about 300 eyes on me.</p>
<p>So I improvised a bit and got it on Andy Kelly.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_152234.png"></p>
<p><em>You lost an apple, “Bubi”.</em></p>
<p>But the biggest embarrassment was yet to came. When Mrs. Norton played the first note of “We are Three Trees”, my heartbeat suddenly got to my nose.</p>
<p>I looked into the hall and there sat Rodrick with a video camera.</p>
<p>I knew, if Rodrick filmed me when I’m singing, he’s gonna show it to everyone and destroy my life.</p>
<p>I didn’t have a single idea what I should do. And when the first line came, I simply shut my mouth close.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_114850.png"></p>
<p><em>We are three trees…</em></p>
<p>Everything went by in the blink of an eye. I thought, if I didn’t actually sing, Rodrick would have nothing against me in his hand. But soon, the other trees noticed I wasn’t singing.</p>
<p>Maybe they thought I was somehow foxier than then, so they also quieted down.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_115100.png"></p>
<p>We three just stood there and didn’t say a single word. Mrs. Norton thought we forgot the lyrics, because she came under the stage from the piano and sang the rest.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_115158.png"></p>
<p>The song only lasted three minutes, but it felt more like thirty. I only wanted the curtains to fall down again and we can quietly stand on stage.</p>
<p>But then I saw Patty Farrell about to go up behind the curtains. If you ignore the blinks, we were three dead trees. And she thought we’ve ruined her hollywood career or something.</p>
<p>But when I saw her standing there, I suddenly realized why I wanted to be a tree in the first place.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_115443.png"></p>
<p>Soon, the other trees were also throwing apples at her. I think even Toto joined us.</p>
<p>Someone knocked Patty’s glasses off her nose and one of the lenses broke. After that, Mrs. Norton had to abruptly end the performance, because Patty couldn’t see a thing without her glasses.</p>
<p>When it ended, I went straight home with my family. But she threw it away when we were exiting.</p>
<p>I hope that others in the hall would find the performance just as funny as I have.</p>
<h3 id="Wednesday"><a href="#Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>The performance definitely did one thing for good: I don’t have to worry about the nickname “Bubi” anymore.</p>
<p>After the fifth session, I saw how they pushed Andy Kelly to the ground. That means, I can finally throw all this behind me.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_120009.png"></p>
<p><em>How’s it going, “Bubi”?</em></p>
<h3 id="Sunday"><a href="#Sunday" class="headerlink" title="Sunday"></a>Sunday</h3><p>After all that in school, I didn’t really have any time to think about the upcoming Christmas. And it’s only ten days away.</p>
<p>I only realized that Christmas is just outside the door when Rodrick sticked his wish list on the fridge.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_120146.png"></p>
<p><em>Rodrick’s wish list</em></p>
<p><em>1. new drums</em></p>
<p><em>2. new minibus</em></p>
<p><em>3. shrunken head</em></p>
<p>Usually I make a really long wish list for Christmas, but this year, I only wanted a video game called “Twisted Wizard”.</p>
<p>Today, Manni went through the Christmas catalog and marked everything he wanted with a thick red marker. Manni circled every single toy there is in there. He even marked a really expensive thing, I think it was an electric car or something like that.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_120359.png"></p>
<p>So I decided to write some advice to him, as an older brother.</p>
<p>I told him that if he circled things that are too expensive, he’s only gonna end up getting sweaters for Christmas. I said, he should choose three or four things that were average-priced, so he could at least get something he actually wanted in the end.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_120913.png"></p>
<p>But of course, Manni insisted on marking basically everything. Well then, he’ll have to learn from experiencing.</p>
<p>When I was seven, I only wished for a Barbie Dream House. And it’s totally NOT because I like girl’s toys as Rodrick claimed.</p>
<p>I only found it suitable for all my toy soldiers.</p>
<p>When Mom and Dad saw my wish list, they had a huge fight over it. Dad said he’s never going to buy me a puppet house, but mom found it good for me to “try out” new types of toys.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_121238.png"></p>
<p>Believe it or not: it was an actual fight that dad won! Dad said to me that I should make a new list with toys “appropriate” for boys.</p>
<p>But I have my secret weapon for Christmas. My uncle Charlie always buys me stuff I want. So I said to him that I wanted a Barbie Dream House, and he said of course he’s gonna buy it.</p>
<p>But when Charlie surprised me with his present at Christmas, it was NOT what I was hoping for. I think he went to a toy shop and simply bought the first thing he saw under the category “Barbie”.</p>
<p>When you see this picture of me holding a beach Barbie in the hand, you’ll know why.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_121645.png"></p>
<p>Dad wasn’t happy when he saw what uncle Charlie gave me. He said, I should either throw it away or sell it.</p>
<p>But I held on to the Barbie. And I’ll admit it, maybe I played with it for once or twice.</p>
<p>So two weeks later, I went to the clinic with a pink Barbie shoe shoved in the nose. And believe me, Rodrick would never forget that moment.</p>
