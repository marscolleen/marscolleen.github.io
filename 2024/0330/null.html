        <h3 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>It’s only a few days till the performance, and I still have no idea how we can make this work.</p>
<p>First, nobody took the actual efforts to learn their roles. And Mrs. Norton is sour about it.</p>
<p>During rehearsal, she’s always hinting the lines.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_144943.png"></p>
<p>Well, I don’t know how it’s gonna work next Tuesday, if Mrs. Norton has to stay ten meters away from the piano.</p>
<p>Other than that, it’s spreading between us that Mrs. Norton is still creating new scenes and figures.</p>
<p>Yesterday, she decided that a first grader will play Dorothy’s dog: Toto. But today, the boy’s mother came and wanted her son upright, because it’s “shameful” to be on all fours.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_145559.png"></p>
<p>Now, we have a dog that’s running on it’s back legs all the time.</p>
<p>But the worst change is that Mrs. Norton composed a song for the TREES. She said that everyone who joined should be “allowed” to sing a song.</p>
<p>So today, we sang the most horrible song of all times for a whole hour.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_145949.png"></p>
<p><em>We are three trees…</em></p>
<p>Thank god Rodrick wasn’t coming to see this absolute catastrophe. Mrs. Norton said, the performance was going to take place in our hall, and I knew, Rodrick would never give up time for a school performance.</p>
<p>But there are good news today. Towards the end of rehearsal, Andy Kelly stomped over Philip James and lost a corner of a tooth, because he couldn’t support his body with his arms.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_150350.png"></p>
<p>The good news is, we’re finally getting armholes in our costumes.</p>
<h3 id="Tuesday"><a href="#Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Today was the great performance of “The Wizard of Oz”! Before it started, there were already a few signs showing that this wasn’t gonna go smooth.</p>
<p>I peeked through the curtains to see how many people were coming and who was there in the first row? My brother Rodrick, even with a tie!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_150921.png"></p>
<p>It was clear then, that I had to sing, and I had to sing with shame. The performance should’ve started at 8, but there was a delay because Philip James suddenly got stage fright.</p>
<p>At first, you would think that when one only needs to quietly sit on the ground and do absolutely nothing, he could hold it for an introduction’s time. But Philip was sweating a whole lot and had to be carried to his parents finally.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_151351.png"></p>
<p>The introduction finally began at half past eight. Just as I said, no one was able to recite their lines, and Mrs. Norton had to run back and forth between the backstage and her piano. The little boy who played Toto needed a stool and a bunch of comic books on the stage, so the part with the dog was totally ruined.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_151836.png"></p>
<p>When the forest scene came, I went into position with the other trees. The curtains went up and right this moment I heard Manni yell.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_152050.png"></p>
<p>Oh, great. I successfully hid this nickname for five years, and now the whole city knows it. I got about 300 eyes on me.</p>
<p>So I improvised a bit and got it on Andy Kelly.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_152234.png"></p>
<p><em>You lost an apple, “Bubi”.</em></p>
<p>But the biggest embarrassment was yet to came. When Mrs. Norton played the first note of “We are Three Trees”, my heartbeat suddenly got to my nose.</p>
<p>I looked into the hall and there sat Rodrick with a video camera.</p>
