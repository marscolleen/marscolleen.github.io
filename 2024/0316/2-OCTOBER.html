        <h3 id="Monday"><a href="#Monday" class="headerlink" title="Monday"></a>Monday</h3><p>It’s finally October, that means only thirty days before Halloween. I like Halloween best out of all holidays, even though mom says I’m too old for all the “Trick or Treat” thing.</p>
<p>My dad also loves Halloween, but he has a different reason. When other parents wait with a big pile of sweets at the door, my dad waits with a big bin full of stinky water. And whenever a teenager passes, he makes them all wet.</p>
<p>I’m not exactly sure if dad really understood the meaning of Halloween. But I really don’t want to leave him out of the fun.</p>
<p>Today, another spooky party is taking place in the Crossland Highschool - with a ghost train and everything. I could persuade my mom into letting me and Rupert go.</p>
<p>Rupert changed into his costume from last year. And he clearly didn’t catch me saying that he should wear normal clothes in the telephone.</p>
<p>I tried to not get disappointed by that. It was the first time I was allowed to the party, and I didn’t want to leave Rupert out. Rodrick told me all about it and I was hoping for the chance since three years ago.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_152516.png"></p>
<p><em>Good evvvveeening.</em></p>
<p>But mom suddenly wanted to get home as quickly as possible, so she just left us there. After we entered, there was a shock. There were vampires jumping all over the place, with no heads.</p>
<p>But the worst had to be the chainsaw man. There was a guy waiting with a hockey mask and had a REAL motor chainsaw in the hand. Rodrick said the thing was made out of rubber. But I didn’t want to take any risks.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_180517.png"></p>
<p>It looked like the chainsaw man was going to murder us. Then mom came to the rescue.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_180829.png"></p>
<p><em>That’s not nice!</em></p>
<p><em>Sorry, ma’am.</em></p>
<p>The man had to show my mom the exit and the party was sort of over. Mom’s appearence might’ve been a bit embarrassing, but I’m gonna let her pass this time.</p>
<h3 id="Saturday"><a href="#Saturday" class="headerlink" title="Saturday"></a>Saturday</h3><p>The Crossland-Party inspired me. They charge five bucks per person, and yet there was at least a 20-meter queue outside.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to build my own ghost train. Then I need Rupert, because mom didn’t want our first floor to turn into a whole spooky castle.</p>
<p>I’m sure Rupert’s dad wouldn’t be happy about this from the get-go, so we decided to build it in Rupert’s basement and simply not telling anything about it to his parents.</p>
<p>We needed the whole day to make an awesome plan. And finally it looked a little something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_181826.png"></p>
<p>I don’t really wanna admit it, but our designs are MUCH cooler than the Crossland one.</p>
<p>Then it was obvious that we had to make advertisements. So we grabbed some paper and started making flyers.</p>
<p>I think maybe we’ve overdone it a bit, but we also wanted enough people to come.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_182623.png"></p>
<p><em>GHOST TRAIN</em></p>
<p><em>With REAL sharks</em></p>
<p><em>50 cents each</em></p>
<p>After we hanged the posters up and went back into Rupert’s basement, it was already 14:30, and we haven’t even started with the actual ghost train.</p>
<p>So our plan had to shrink.</p>
<p>When it was three, we went up to look whether there were actually people. And, there was already a line with about twenty kids from around the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>I know we wrote 50 cents on the advertisement, but desperate situations called for desperate measures.</p>
<p>So I told them it actually costs 2 dollars to enter and the 50 cent was a mistake.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_183517.png"></p>
<p>The first person that paid the two dollars was Simon Snella. After he gave us the money, we lead him inside, and me and Rupert went into the screaming section.</p>
<p>It was essentially just a bed, with us on both sides.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_183902.png"></p>
<p>Maybe we underestimated the spookiness, because Simon could only shake under the bed for a long time. We thought we could get him out, but he just wouldn’t cooperate.</p>
<p>I thought about the money that was gonna be in our pockets, and it’s all nothing because this guy is blocking our bed, and then, I knew it, he had to go!</p>
<p>Rupert’s dad came into the basement. At first, I was happy to see him, because I thought he was going to help us get Simon out and get the cash flowing in.</p>
<p>But he definitely wasn’t in the mood to help us.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_185904.png"></p>
<p>Rupert’s father wanted to know what we were doing and why was Simon Snella under the bed.</p>
<p>We told him that the basement was turned into a ghost train and that Simon PAID for it. We only had time for the screaming section and the blood sea was made out of half a bottle of ketchup.</p>
<p>I wanted to show Rupert’s dad our plan, in order to persuade him that this was real business, but he just wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_190635.png"></p>
<p>And shortly it became clear: the ghost train business came to an abrupt end.</p>
<p>But good news: because Rupert’s dad didn’t believe us, we don’t have to give Simon his money back. So that means we earned two dollars today.</p>
<h3 id="Sunday"><a href="#Sunday" class="headerlink" title="Sunday"></a>Sunday</h3><p>Rupert was busted after the ghost train thing. He isn’t allowed to watch TV for a whole week AND I’m not allowed to visit him.</p>
<p>I find the second part totally unreasonable, because he could still visit me but I can’t. Then where am I supposed to play my video games?</p>
<p>Rupert said sorry today. So I wanted to do something good this evening. So I watched Rupert’s favorite show and broadcasted it through my telephone to him, so at least he could know what happened.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_095824.png"></p>
<p><em>Wow, look at the flamethrower!</em></p>
<p><em>Whatever, it’s not so important.</em></p>
<p>I tried to describe what was going on as accurate as possible, but to be honest, I don’t think it really made any difference.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_100307.png"></p>
<p><em>It’s getting really funny.</em></p>
<p><em>Yeah! Hahahaha! That was really hilarious.</em></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday"><a href="#Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Rupert’s punishment is finally over, just in time for Halloween. I went to him  to check out his costume, and I have to say, I’m a bit jealous.</p>
<p>Rupert’s mom got a knight costume for him, and it is MUCH cooler than last year. </p>
<p>His costume has a helmet, a shield, a sword and EVERYTHING.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_101016.png"></p>
<p>I only have a second-hand costume. And: I’m still not sure about what I should be tomorrow night. Maybe I’ll figure something out last second. I think there’s nothing wrong with the toilet paper mummy again.</p>
<p>But tomorrow it will rain, so maybe that’s not so good an idea.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_101524.png"></p>
<p>On the last year, some adults in the neighbourhood got sour because of my costume, and I think it really affected the amount of sweets I got.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_101844.png"></p>
<p><em>What are YOU supposed to be?</em></p>
<p><em>A cowboy.</em></p>
<p>But I really don’t have enough time to get a proper costume, because, I’m doing soemthing much more important: planning the best route for us.</p>
<p>This year, I have a plan taht can definitely get us twice the candies last year.</p>
<h3 id="Halloween"><a href="#Halloween" class="headerlink" title="Halloween"></a>Halloween</h3><p>About an hour before we went out, I still had no costumes. Then, I promptly decided that I shall be a cowboy two times in a row.</p>
<p>Then mom knocked on my door and surprised me with a pirate costume. It has an eye patch, a hook and all the stuff.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_102458.png"></p>
<p>At half past six Rupert was standing in front of the door with his knight costume on, but he looked different from yesterday.</p>
<p>Rupert’s mom improved the safety of the costume, so that others can’t even recognize what he’s supposed to be from the outside.</p>
<p>She cut out a big hole on the helmet, so that he can see the outside better, and his whole costume was covered with light strips. Under the costume, he still had to wear his winterwear and instead of the sword, he was carrying a funny lantern in his hand.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_133829.png"></p>
<p>As usual, I took my pillow case and we wanted to go. But mom stopped us before I could get my foot out of the door.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_133936.png"></p>
<p><em>Take Manni with you!</em></p>
<p>Man, I kinda expected the whole thing to have a twist when she gave me the costume.</p>
<p>I told mom it was UNLIKELY for us to take Manni because we wanted to visit 152 houses in three hours. And we would reach the edge of the neighbourhood, and all this is too dangerous for a little boy.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t have said the last part, because before I was able to catch up on what was going on, mom said to dad that he should take care of us in case we go too far. Dad wanted to argue, but when mom said something, there’s no coming back.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_134310.png"></p>
<p>We didn’t even make it out of the yard when our neighbour Mr. Mitchell joined us with his son Jeremy.</p>
<p>Manni and Jeremy didn’t want to stop by any houses that smelled awful. That included practically every single house in our block.</p>
<p>Dad began to chat with Mr. Mitchell about football, and every time one of them wanted to say something important, they stopped walking.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_134600.png"></p>
<p>That means, we could only manage one house in twenty minutes.</p>
<p>After a few hours, dad and Mr. Mitchell went home with the little ones.</p>
<p>I was delighted, because Rupert and I could finally go. There was practically nothing in my pillow case, and I wanted to make use of as much time as possible.</p>
<p>Soon Rupert said he needed a pause. At first I thought he could stand through the three quarters. But when we reached my grandma, it became clear that he really needed a trip to the bathroom. So I said to him that if he returns in more than a minute, I’ll starting eating his sweets.</p>
<p>Then we moved on. But it was already ten thirty and that means Halloween is already over for most adults.</p>
<p>Then you shoudln’t be surprised when they open the door in their pajamas and looked annoyed.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_140138.png"></p>
<p>So we returned. After dad and Manni went away, we did quite good, and I was particularly satisfied with the amount of candies we got.</p>
<p>A group of teenagers on a truck suddenly appeared when we were halfway.</p>
<p>The guy on the loading part had an extinguisher in his hand and he splashed us with water.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_140655.png"></p>
<p>I have to say, Rupert did it quite nicely, because he blocked about 95% of the water with his shield. Or our sweets would be soaked.</p>
<p>When the truck went along, I shouted something to them. I didn’t know that I would regret it two seconds later.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_140900.png"></p>
<p><em>We’re calling the bullies!</em></p>
<p>The driver made an emergency brake and turned. I and Rupert ran for our lives, but the guys were on our tails.</p>
<p>The only safe place I could think of right this moment was my grandma’s house. We might’ve used a few gardens on the way. Grandma was already in bed, but I know she hid a second key under the doormat.</p>
<p>When we got into the house, I looked through the window to check whether the guys followed us. And there they were. I tried to talk them into leaving, but they just wouldn’t loosen up.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_172306.png"></p>
<p><em>Now we have SHELTER, and you can’t get us anymore.</em></p>
<p>A few moments later, it was clear that they were going to wait for us. So we decided to spend the night here. And we also decided to be cocky: we were going to act as monkeys.</p>
<p>At least I made monkey noises. But Rupert sounded more like an owl, but it’s fine.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_172532.png"></p>
<p>Then I called mom to inform her that we were going to spend the night at my grandma’s. But she sounded sour.</p>
<p>She said, tomorrow we still have to go to school, and we should go back home. I had to stand through a whole outbreak there.</p>
<p>When I looked out of the window again, the vehicle disappeared. But I know, those dudes hid somewhere to spy on us.</p>
<p>We sneaked from the back door outside, jumped across grandma’s garden fences and ran the whole way to the main road. I thought we had a better chance there, because there were no traffic lighting whatsoever.</p>
<p>The dark road is already spooky enough without a truck full of dudes. Every time a car came, we hid in the bushes. Because of this, it took us thirty minutes to finish 100 meters.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_173403.png"></p>
<p>You’re probably not gonna believe it, but we made it back home, without being discovered. When we reached our destination, we let out a deep breath.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_173540.png"></p>
<p>Then suddenly there was a scary scream and we saw water coming for us.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_174722.png"></p>
<p>Man, I TOTALLY forgot about dad.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_174752.png"></p>
<p>When I and Rupert got into the house, we put all the sweets out on the kitchen table.</p>
<p>The only ones worthed saving were a few mint bonbons (that were wrapped in foil) and the toothbrushes from Dr. Garrison.</p>
<p>I think, next Halloween I’ll just stay in and grab a few chocolate bars from the bowl that mom always puts on the fridge.</p>
