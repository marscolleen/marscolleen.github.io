        <h3 id="Monday"><a href="#Monday" class="headerlink" title="Monday"></a>Monday</h3><p>It’s finally October, that means only thirty days before Halloween. I like Halloween best out of all holidays, even though mom says I’m too old for all the “Trick or Treat” thing.</p>
<p>My dad also loves Halloween, but he has a different reason. When other parents wait with a big pile of sweets at the door, my dad waits with a big bin full of stinky water. And whenever a teenager passes, he makes them all wet.</p>
<p>I’m not exactly sure if dad really understood the meaning of Halloween. But I really don’t want to leave him out of the fun.</p>
<p>Today, another spooky party is taking place in the Crossland Highschool - with a ghost train and everything. I could persuade my mom into letting me and Rupert go.</p>
<p>Rupert changed into his costume from last year. And he clearly didn’t catch me saying that he should wear normal clothes in the telephone.</p>
<p>I tried to not get disappointed by that. It was the first time I was allowed to the party, and I didn’t want to leave Rupert out. Rodrick told me all about it and I was hoping for the chance since three years ago.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_152516.png"></p>
<p><em>Good evvvveeening.</em></p>
<p>But mom suddenly wanted to get home as quickly as possible, so she just left us there. After we entered, there was a shock. There were vampires jumping all over the place, with no heads.</p>
<p>But the worst had to be the chainsaw man. There was a guy waiting with a hockey mask and had a REAL motor chainsaw in the hand. Rodrick said the thing was made out of rubber. But I didn’t want to take any risks.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_180517.png"></p>
<p>It looked like the chainsaw man was going to murder us. Then mom came to the rescue.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_180829.png"></p>
<p><em>That’s not nice!</em></p>
<p><em>Sorry, ma’am.</em></p>
<p>The man had to show my mom the exit and the party was sort of over. Mom’s appearence might’ve been a bit embarrassing, but I’m gonna let her pass this time.</p>
<h3 id="Saturday"><a href="#Saturday" class="headerlink" title="Saturday"></a>Saturday</h3><p>The Crossland-Party inspired me. They charge five bucks per person, and yet there was at least a 20-meter queue outside.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to build my own ghost train. Then I need Rupert, because mom didn’t want our first floor to turn into a whole spooky castle.</p>
<p>I’m sure Rupert’s dad wouldn’t be happy about this from the get-go, so we decided to build it in Rupert’s basement and simply not telling anything about it to his parents.</p>
<p>We needed the whole day to make an awesome plan. And finally it looked a little something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_181826.png"></p>
<p>I don’t really wanna admit it, but our designs are MUCH cooler than the Crossland one.</p>
<p>Then it was obvious that we had to make advertisements. So we grabbed some paper and started making flyers.</p>
<p>I think maybe we’ve overdone it a bit, but we also wanted enough people to come.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_182623.png"></p>
<p><em>GHOST TRAIN</em></p>
<p><em>With REAL sharks</em></p>
<p><em>50 cents each</em></p>
<p>After we hanged the posters up and went back into Rupert’s basement, it was already 14:30, and we haven’t even started with the actual ghost train.</p>
<p>So our plan had to shrink.</p>
<p>When it was three, we went up to look whether there were actually people. And, there was already a line with about twenty kids from around the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>I know we wrote 50 cents on the advertisement, but desperate situations called for desperate measures.</p>
<p>So I told them it actually costs 2 dollars to enter and the 50 cent was a mistake.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_183517.png"></p>
<p>The first person that paid the two dollars was Simon Snella. After he gave us the money, we lead him inside, and me and Rupert went into the screaming section.</p>
<p>It was essentially just a bed, with us on both sides.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_183902.png"></p>
<p>Maybe we underestimated the spookiness, because Simon could only shake under the bed for a long time. We thought we could get him out, but he just wouldn’t cooperate.</p>
<p>I thought about the money that was gonna be in our pockets, and it’s all nothing because this guy is blocking our bed, and then, I knew it, he had to go!</p>
<p>Rupert’s dad came into the basement. At first, I was happy to see him, because I thought he was going to help us get Simon out and get the cash flowing in.</p>
<p>But he definitely wasn’t in the mood to help us.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_185904.png"></p>
<p>Rupert’s father wanted to know what we were doing and why was Simon Snella under the bed.</p>
<p>We told him that the basement was turned into a ghost train and that Simon PAID for it. We only had time for the screaming section and the blood sea was made out of half a bottle of ketchup.</p>
<p>I wanted to show Rupert’s dad our plan, in order to persuade him that this was real business, but he just wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_190635.png"></p>
<p>And shortly it became clear: the ghost train business came to an abrupt end.</p>
<p>But good news: because Rupert’s dad didn’t believe us, we don’t have to give Simon his money back. So that means we earned two dollars today.</p>
<h3 id="Sunday"><a href="#Sunday" class="headerlink" title="Sunday"></a>Sunday</h3><p>Rupert was busted after the ghost train thing. He isn’t allowed to watch TV for a whole week AND I’m not allowed to visit him.</p>
<p>I find the second part totally unreasonable, because he could still visit me but I can’t. Then where am I supposed to play my video games?</p>
<p>Rupert said sorry today. So I wanted to do something good this evening. So I watched Rupert’s favorite show and broadcasted it through my telephone to him, so at least he could know what happened.</p>
