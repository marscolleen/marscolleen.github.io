        <h3 id="24"><a href="#24" class="headerlink" title="24"></a>24</h3><p>When I woke up the next morning, I was alone. I looked all around me. Light fog was on the hill, and no sight of Tschick. But because his air mattress was still there, I didn’t really put it on my mind. I tried to fall asleep again, but the noise completely chased my sleepiness away. I went up the sightseeing platform and looked down from all sides. I was the only person on the hill. The shop was still closed. The sun looked like a red peach in a bowl of milk, and along with the first streaks of sunshine came a group of cyclists, and then it wasn’t ten minutes until Tschick also climbed up the hill. I felt a lot easier. He just ran back and checked on the Lada. it was still there. We chatted for a while, and finally decided on going on with the car immediately, because this whole waiting was absolutely pointless.</p>
<p>The cyclists also got on the hill while we were talking, a dozen boys and girls our age and one grown-up. They were eating breakfast and talking quietly with one another, and they really looked amazing. The group was too small for a class trip, too big for a family and too well-dressed for a beadhouse tour. But something was up with them. They all wore rags, but it didn’t look cheap, on the opposite side, it looked very expensive and somewhat hindered. And they all had really, really clean faces. I don’t know how I’m supposed to describe it, but they were somehow clean. Tschick asked a girl about which place they were from, and the girl said: “From nowhere. We are nobels on the bicycle. We ride everywhere.” She said it seriously and politely. Maybe she wanted to pull off a joke or something, and it was the bike tour of the clown school nearby.</p>
<p>“And you guys?” She asked.</p>
<p>“What about us?”</p>
<p>“Are you also making a bike tour?”</p>
<p>“We are mobilists.”</p>

        <h3 id="23"><a href="#23" class="headerlink" title="23"></a>23</h3><p>He went back to the street. After we arrived at a backery, we suddenly got a craving for coffee. We parked the car in a bush behind the village and walked back to the backery on foot. We bought some coffee and munched on bread rolls. As I was about to bite into my roll, someone behind me called out: “Klingenberg, what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Lutz Heckel, the lump on two sticks, was sitting at the table behind us. Next to him, a bigger lump on two sticks and a not-so-big lump on pillars.</p>
<p>“And the Mongolian is here.” Heckel said, surprised.</p>
<p>“Visiting relatives.” I said and turned back quickly. It wasn’t the time to talk for me.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you have relatives here?”</p>
<p>“I do.” Tschick said, and fiddled with his coffee cup to protest. I couldn’t remember whether I saw Heckel at Tatjana’s party, but next up, he asked how we got here. Tschick told him some bullshit about a bike tour.</p>
<p>“Classmate of yours?” I heared the big lump ask, and then I didn’t hear anything for a long time. Some time later, car keys climpered at the table behind us, and Dad Heckel went into the backery. He came back out with an armful of bread rolls, put four on our table and said: “Gotta get some energy supply for our rider!” Then he knocked the table with his knuckles, and family lump went direction market.</p>
<p>“Uh.” Tschick said, and I didn’t know what I was supposed to say. We sat for quite a bit of time in front of this backery. We really needed the coffee, and the rolls. Every half an hour, a sighting bus with tourists on it would go through the market. There’s a castle somewhere in this village. Tschick sat with his back against the bus stop, but I looked the whole time at those retirees who tend to get on this bus. They all wore brown or beige clothes and a funny hat, and when they went past us, where there was a small step, they all look like they’ve just ran a marathon. I couldn’t imagine myself being a beige retiree when I’m old. Every old man that I know seem to be one, the ladies too. It was hard for me to imagine that all these ladies all had their youth at some point. When they were the same age as Tatjana and dressed up and danced at nightclubs, about fifty or a hundred years ago. Of course not everyone. Maybe some were already ugly at that time, but maybe it’s because they’ve been through something. But the ugly have their plans for the future too, just like normal people. And turnig into a beige retiree was definitely not a part of it. The more I think of it, the more depressed I get. The most depressing thought was, that these retirees were also once not boring, and someone probably fell in love with them, and someone probably sat on his Indian tower seventy years ago just to wait for the light in her room. These girls were now retirees, but you couldn’t tell them apart from other beige retirees. Everyone has the same gray hair and fat nose and ears, and that depressed me so hard, I felt horrible.</p>
<p>“Shh,” said Tschick, looking past me. I followed his gaze and spotted two police officers walking along a row of parked cars, looking at each license plate. Without saying a word, we took our paper cups and strolled inconspicuously back to the bushes where the Lada was parked. Then we drove back the way we had come in the morning, onto the country road and off at a hundred. We didn’t have to discuss what to do next for long. In a wooded area we found a parking lot where people parked their cars to go for a walk. And luckily there were quite a lot of cars there, because it wasn’t that easy to find one where you could unscrew the license plates. Most of them didn’t have any screws at all. What we finally found was an old VW Beetle with a Munich license plate. We put our license plates on it in return, hoping that it wouldn’t notice so quickly. Then we raced a few kilometers on some back roads through the fields before we turned into a huge forest and parked the Lada on an abandoned sawmill site. We packed our backpacks and hiked through the forest. We had no intention of abandoning the Lada just yet, but despite the license plate change we weren’t entirely comfortable with it. It seemed the smartest thing to take the car out of traffic for a while. Maybe spend a day or two in the forest and come back later, that was the plan. Although - it wasn’t a real plan either. We didn’t even know if they had really been looking for us. And whether they would stop looking for us in a few days. Our path led uphill the whole time, and at the top the forest thinned out. There was a small viewing platform with a wall around it and a pretty great view over the countryside. But the best thing was a small kiosk where you could buy water and chocolate bars and ice cream. So we didn’t have to starve, and that’s why we stayed near this kiosk. Not far down the mountain was a sloping meadow, and there we found a quiet spot behind huge elderberry bushes. We lay in the sun and dozed, and that’s how we spent the day. For the night we stocked up on plenty of Snickers and Coke and then crawled into our sleeping bags and listened to the crickets chirping. All day hikers, cyclists and buses had passed by to enjoy the view, but when dusk fell no one came and we had the whole mountain to ourselves. It was still warm, almost too warm, and Tschick, who had managed to coax two beers out of the kiosk owner with plenty of gel in his hair, opened the bottles with his lighter. The stars above us became more and more numerous. We lay on our backs, and between the small stars smaller ones appeared, and between the smaller ones even smaller ones, and the black sank further and further away.</p>
<p>“This is madness,” said Tschick.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said, “this is madness.”</p>
<p>“This is much better than television. Although television is good too. Do you know War of the Worlds?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Do you know Starship Troopers?”</p>
<p>“With the monkeys?”</p>
<p>“With insects.”</p>
<p>“And at the end a brain like that? The giant brain beetle with such - with such slimy things?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“It’s madness.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s madness.”</p>
<p>“And can you imagine, somewhere up there, on one of those stars - it’s exactly like that now!</p>
<p>There really are insects living there, which are fighting a huge battle for supremacy in space right this second - and nobody knows about it.”</p>
<p>“Except us,” I said.</p>
<p>“Except us, exactly.” “But we are the only ones who know that. Even the insects don’t know that we know that.” “Seriously, do you believe that?” Tschick leaned on his elbow and looked at me. “Do you think there’s anything else? I don’t necessarily mean insects. But something?” “I don’t know. I once heard that you can calculate it. It’s totally unlikely that there is anything, but everything is infinitely large, and totally unlikely times infinite does result in a number, a number of planets where there is something. Because it worked for us too. And there are definitely giant insects up there somewhere.” “That’s exactly my opinion, exactly my opinion!” Tschick lay back on his back and looked up with effort. “Incredible, isn’t it?” he said. “Yes, incredible.” “I’m totally overwhelmed.” “And can you imagine: The insects have an insect cinema too, of course! They make films on their planet, and somewhere in the insect cinema they are watching a film that takes place on Earth and is about two boys who steal a car.” “And it’s a total horror film!” said Tschick. “The insects are disgusted by us because we’re not slimy at all.” “But everyone thinks it’s just science fiction, and in reality we don’t exist. People and cars - that’s total nonsense for them. No one believes that.”</p>
<p>“Except two young insects! They believe that. Two young insects in training who have just hijacked an army helicopter and are flying around the insect planet and think exactly the same thing. They think we exist because we think they exist too.”</p>
<p>“Incredible!”</p>
<p>“Yes, incredible.”</p>
<p>I looked at the stars with their incomprehensible infinity and I was somehow frightened. I was touched and frightened at the same time. I thought about the insects that were now almost visible in their small, shimmering galaxy and then I turned to Tschick and he looked at me and looked me in the eyes and said that it was all madness, and that was true. It really was madness.</p>
<p>And the crickets chirped all night long.</p>

        <h3 id="22"><a href="#22" class="headerlink" title="22"></a>22</h3><p>I didn’t really get any sleep, and the good thing about that is, I already saw the farmers as the first streak of light appeared, who were on a tractor coming closer. I didn’t know whether he had actually seen us, but I woke Tschick up and he started the car immediately. We went horizontal under the hill, and then back on the streets and go.</p>
<p>The chocolate cookies turned edible again, and after we ate them for breakfast, Tschick tried to teach me how to drive on an empty field. I wasn’t really keen on it at first, but Tschick said it was stupid if you stole a car and didn’t know how to drive. Other than that, he also said that I was just scared, and that’s right.</p>
<p>Tschick demonstrated a round for me, and I tried to pay attention to what he actually was doing, which pedal he was stepping and how he switched the gear. I’ve seen it often enough with my parents, but I’ve never really cared. I didn’t know exactly which pedals are which.</p>
<p>“Left is coupling. You just let it come slowly and give gas and – you see? You see?”</p>
<p>Of course I didn’t see a single thing. Let it come? Give gas? Tschick explained it to me.</p>
<p>First, you put on the first gear. You’ll step on the coupling, tip a little on gas with your right foot, and let go of the coupling at the same time. That’s the most difficult, the starting. It took me twenty tries before the Lada finally started to move, and then I was so surprised, my two feet let go – the car made a noise, and the motor went shut.</p>
<p>“Just go on coupling again, then you can’t stall it. During braking, too: Always coupling at the same time, or you’ll stall it.”</p>
<p>But it took a while before the braking. You also had to press the braking pedal with your right foot, and I wasn’t clear of that. For whatever reason, I just wanted both feet to go on the brake. When I finally managed to drive the Lada, I switched to the first gear and drove across the field, and it was out of this world. The Lada did what I wanted. As I got quicker, the motor started to howl, and Tschick said that I should step on coupling for three seconds. I did exactly that, and Tschick switched it to the second gear for me. “More gas!” He said, and suddenly, I shot out with thirty. Fortunately, the field was very big. I practiced for a few hours. And after that, I could start the car all by myself, switch the car to the third gear and turn it up again without stalling. I was drenched in sweat, but I didn’t want to give up either. Tschick laid on an air matress outside and enjoyed the sun, and only two hikers came the whole day without noticing us. I made a full brake next to Tschick and asked him how the short-circuit worked. Because, after I could drive, I wanted to know the whole thing.</p>
<p>Tschick flipped up his sunglasses, sat down in the driver’s seat and rummaged around in the cables with both hands: “You have to put this on permanent plus, the fifteen on the thirty. There’s the thick clamp for that. And it has to be thick. That puts the ignition system under voltage, and then you put the fifty on it, which leads to the starter relay - like that. The control plus.” “And that’s the case with every car?” “I only know this one. But my brother says yes. The fifteen, the thirty and the fifty.” “And that’s it?” “You still have to kill the steering wheel. The rest is a piece of cake. Here with your foot, and voila. And bridge the fuel pump, of course.” Of course, bridge the fuel pump. I didn’t say anything else for a while. In physics we had learned a lot about electric current. That there was plus and minus and that the electrons rushed through the cable like water and so on. But that obviously had nothing to do with what was going on in our Lada. Tax plus, permanent plus - it sounded as if a completely different current was flowing through this car than through the cables in physics class, as if we had landed in a parallel world. But physics class was probably the parallel world. Because the fact that it worked showed that Tschick was right.</p>

        <h3 id="21"><a href="#21" class="headerlink" title="21"></a>21</h3><p>Wind came. The sun disappeared behind dark clouds, and two raindrops hit the wind shield. The drops were so big, that almost the whole screen got wet. Tschick drove faster, tall trees were shattering in the wind, and suddenly, a gust almost had our car upside-down. Tschick turned to a road between two fields. The piano solo went intense, and after a kilometer, the road stopped in the middle of the field.</p>
<p>“I’m not going back.” Tschick said, and went straight forward without braking. The crops were against our doors and smashed on the screen. Tschick let the car run carelessly in the field and gave a lot of gas. The motor went on slowly, and the bonnet started to split this golden sea into two. Though the Lada itself was making weird noises, he eventually managed it without too much of an effort. But orientating was hard, you couldn’t really look over the crops. No horizon. A third raindrop hit us. The field went slightly uphill. We drove small curves and stumbled upon a gap, which we ourselves made a minute ago. I suggested Tschick try to write our names, so others could read it from a helicopter or later on Google Earth. We already lost track by the vertical stroke of the T. We just drove around, stumbled upon one hill after another, and when we were somewhat higher, the field suddenly came to an end. Tschick braked at the last second. With the back half still in the corn field and the front half already out, we observed the landscape. A herd of cows were before us, and it was simply green, with groups of trees, narrow streets and endless hills and hills and mountains and forests. The clouds were drifting away at the horizon. You could see sheet lightning over a small church, but it was dead silent. The fourth raindrop came. Tschick had the motor on, and I took Clayderman out.</p>
<p>We only looked for a couple of minutes. Small, bright clouds went under the dark ones and came to us.</p>
<p>“<em>Independence Day</em>.” Tschick said.</p>
<p>We grabbed bread, cola and jam out, and as we were trying to set up a picnic in our car, it went pitch dark. It was only early afternoon, but it’s dark like in the night. Shortly after, I saw a cow get pushed back like in a meadow. I was shocked at first, but Tschick saw it too. Every other cow turned its ass to the wind, but they just flipped over. And then the wind went away, as suddenly as how it came. Nothing happened for a minute, you couldn’t even read the writing on the cola bottle. Then a bucket of water was poured on our wind shield, and it came down like a wall.</p>
<p>For hours. It was bustling and lightning went crazy. When the rain finally stopped at the evening and we climbed out of the car, the whole field was flat, and the lawn in front of us turned into a catastrophe. It was impossible to drive on, so we decided to stay. And so, we spent our first night on the hill, in our car, on our seats. It wasn’t that comfortable, but we didn’t have much to work with, considering the mess outside.</p>

        <h3 id="20"><a href="#20" class="headerlink" title="20"></a>20</h3><p>My arm hanged out of the window, my head was on my arm. We were driving through fields at tempo 30, with the sun shining upon us, somewhere behind Rahnsdorf, and it was the most beautiful and relaxing moment I’ve ever experienced. I couldn’t really say what was relaxing about it, because it was only a car ride, and I’ve experienced those a lot. But there’s a difference between whether you’re sitting next to an adult who keeps on babbling about assholes and Angela Merkel, or whether there’s just nobody there and it’s silence. Tschick also had his arm out of the window and drove the car with his right hand. It was, as if there were only the Lada and the field in this world, it was something else, another universe. Everything was bigger, the colors brighter, the sounds Dolby Surround, and I, to be honest, wouldn’t be surprised if a dinosaur or a huge cruise suddenly appeared in front of us.</p>
<p>We drove the direct way out of Berlin, the morning rush hour behind us, and stumbled upon the lonely streets of the suburb. The first thing we noticed was that we didn’t have a map. Only a street plan of Berlin.</p>
<p>“Maps are for dummies.” Tschick said, and logically, he had a point. But if you want to make it to Walachei without knowing where Rahnsdorf is, the problem was obvious. So we just went south. Because Walachei is in Romania, and Romania is towards the south.</p>
<p>The next problem was we didn’t know which direction was south. Though it’s just the morning, clouds were starting to pile up, and you couldn’t see the sun anymore. It was at least forty degrees outside, even hotter than yesterday.</p>
<p>I had this small compass on my key chain, which I got from a gum ATM, but somehow it didn’t work properly in the car, and it just showed whichever direction it wanted outside. We even stopped just to make sure. And when I got on the car again, I realized that something was under my foot mat – a music cassette. The name was <em>The Solid Gold Collection of Richard Clayderman</em>, and it wasn’t really music, but just piano solos like Mozart. But we didn’t have anything else, and because we also didn’t know what was possibly on there, we played it. Fourty-five minutes. I had to give in: After we’ve had enough of <em>Rieshah</em> and his piano, we also decided to try the other side, which was the exact same, but it was still better than nothing. Seriously, I didn’t tell Tschick, and I really don’t want to say it now: But this minor shit really pulled the plug for me. I had to think about Tatjana and how she looked at me when I gave her the drawing, and then we crampled on the highway with “Ballade pour Adeline”.</p>
<p>We had some trouble on the feeder road, and Tschick, who could drive to some extent but hasn’t experienced the German highway yet, really went hardcore on it. When he was supposed to merge into the traffic, he braked, gave gas, braked again, and then went in the speed of a snail, and finally managed to switch to the left lane. Thank goodness nobody rammed us from behind. I thought, if we died here, Rieshah and his piano were to blame. But we didn’t. We agreed to driving out at the next exit and only take street and field roads from here. There was a problem: There was a man in a black Mercedes next to us, he looked at us and made wild moves with his hands. He seemed to be writing out numbers with his had, and then he held his phone up high as if he were recording our license plate. That got me on my nerves, but Tschick just shrudded his shoulders and acted as if he was <em>thankful</em> for letting us notice that we were driving with lights on, and then we lost him in the traffic.</p>
<p>Tschick looked older than fourteen, but definitely not eighteen. But we didn’t know what he looked like in a running car through the dirty wind shield. To test it, we even drove a few rounds on a deserted road. I stood by the road, and Tschick had to drive past me for like twenty times, so that I could see how adult-like he looked. He put both sleeping bags on his seat as pillows, had my sunglasses tucked in his hair, shoved a cigarette in his mouth and stuck a few pieces of black tape on his face to try and mimic the Kevin Kurányi beard. But he didn’t look like Kevin Kurányi at all, but just a fourteen year old who stuck tape on his face. In the end, he ripped everything again and only kept a small piece under the nose. He looked like Hitler, but in some sort, that worked out fine. And because we’re in Brandenburg, it couldn’t cause any politcal conflict.</p>
<p>Now, there was only the problem with the orientation. We saw Dresden on a sign. I was fairly sure Dresden was to the south, so we went in that direction. But when we had to choose between two roads, we just took whichever was smaller and had less traffic, and then there were less and less guides, and they only show the way to the next village and not Dresden. Is Burig on the south or is it Freienbink? We threw a coin. Tschick found the thing with the coin great and said, we were only gonna depend on the coin from now. Head for right, and tail for left, and when it stood, we went straight. But logically, the coin couldn’t stand, so we didn’t make any forward progress. So we gave up the coin eventually and just went right-left-right-legt, that was my suggestion, but it wasn’t any better. You would think that you couldn’t go in a circle if you switched between left and right, but we somehow managed it. When we reached a sign with left to Markgrafpieske and right to Spreenhagen for the third time, Tschick came up with the idea to only go to places that started with a M or a T. But there were too little of those. I thought we could choose those places whose distance was a prime number, but we made a mistake with <em>Bad Freienwalde 51 km</em>, it was too late when we realized it (three times seventeen).</p>
<p>Finally, the sun shined through. The road split in a corn field. Left was endless cobblestone, and right was endless sand. We had difficulty telling which road was more towards south. The sun wasn’t really in the middle. It was almost eleven.</p>
<p>“South is that way.” Tschick said.</p>
<p>“That’s east.”</p>
<p>We got out and ate a few chocolate cookies which were already half melted. The insects in the corn field made a weird noise.</p>
<p>“You do know that you can tell the directions with a watch, right?” Tschick held his watch up. An old, Russian model. He had it between us, but I didn’t know how it’s supposed to work, and he didn’t either. I think you had to point a hand toward the sun, and then the other hand shows north or something. But right now, it’s almost eleven, and both hands are pointing toward the sun.</p>
<p>“Maybe it can also show south.” Tschick said.</p>
<p>“And south is gonna be over there half an hour later?”</p>
<p>“Maybe because it’s summertime. It doesn’t work in summer. I’ll turn it back an hour.”</p>
<p>“And what’s that supposed to do? The hands turn in an hour, but the directions don’t change that fast.”</p>
<p>“But when the compass turns itself – maybe it’s a geocompass.”</p>
<p>“A geocompass!”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you heard anything of it?”</p>
<p>“A geocompass has nothing to do with turning. It doesn’t turn.” I said, “It has something to do with alcohol. There’s alcohol involved.”</p>
<p>“You’re definitely talking shit here.”</p>
<p>“I learned it from a book, where a captain broke the compass because he was an alcoholic, and then the whole ship lost directions.”</p>
<p>“That sounds like a hell of a book.”</p>
<p>“You have a point. It’s called, I believe, <em>The Seabear</em>. Or <em>The Seawolf</em>.”</p>
<p>“You mean <em>Steppenwolf</em>. It’s also about dragon. My brother reads these kinds of things.”</p>
<p>“Steppenwolf just happened to also be a <em>band</em>.” I said.</p>
<p>“So, I would say, if we don’t know where south is, we just take the sand route.” Tschick said and put his watch back on. “There’s less people.”</p>
<p>And just as usual, he was right. It was a good decision. We didn’t see any cars for a whole hour. We were at a place where no more houses could be seen at the horizon. Pumpkins lied on a field, about a medicine ball’s size.</p>

        <h3 id="19"><a href="#19" class="headerlink" title="19"></a>19</h3><p>Sunday morning. Four o’clock, Tschick said, that would be the best time. Four in the morning. I basically didn’t sleep and was awake for the night and jumped up when I heard steps on our terrasse. I rushed to the door, and there stood Tschick with a backpack in the dark. We whispered, but there were no reasons to do so. Tschick put the backpack in the doorway, and then we started.</p>
<p>On the way from Potsdam back here, he had parked the Lada on the street. It was only a ten minute walk from our house. A fox ran direction city center by our feet. A vehicle of the transporation management center or something flew by, a retiree went past us coughing like crazy. We felt as if it was day. Thirty meters from the Lada, Tschick gave a sign to stand still, and I stood by a wall and let my heart beat. Tschick found a yellow tennis ball from his pockets. He pressed the ball on the door handle and twirled with his other hand. I couldn’t really tell what he was up to, but Tschick said: “Professionals at work!” and opened the door. He winked at me.</p>
<p>Then he fiddled with the cables again, started the car and tried to park around our front steps. I sat on the passenger’s seat and examined the tennis ball. A normal tennis ball with a hole of about a finger’s size.</p>
<p>“And it works with every car?”</p>
<p>“Not with every one. But ones with central locking – it creates a vacuum.”</p>
<p>He scraped out of the parking spot, and I pressed the ball in my hand and couldn’t even hold it properly. Russians, I thought.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, we loaded the Lada full. Our garage had a direct door to the house, and we shoved everything that seemed to make sense in. At first bread, biscuits and crackers and some conserved cans, because we thought maybe we could also eat that. We obviously needed plates and knives and spoons for that. We packed a three-man tent, sleepings bags and mats. Then we took the mats out and opted for air matresses. Eventually, half the household was in the car, and then we started to take them all out again: You didn’t need the most of them. It was going back and forth. We had trouble deciding whether you needed rollerblades. If we were out of gas, one of us could bring the tank and rollerblade to a gas station, that was Tschick’s opinion, but I thought the foldable bicycle could also do the job. At the very end, we decided to bring a pack of water, and as it turned out later, that was the best idea ever. Or the only good one. Because, other stuff were more or less shit. Tennis rackets, a huge pile of mangas, four pairs of shoes, my dad’s toolbox, six frozen pizzas. What we didn’t bring were phones. “Then none of those losers could find us.” Tschick said.</p>
<p>And also no CDs. The Lada had two huge speakers, but only a broken radio which was tucked under the glove section. I was, to be honest, happy about it, because that meant I didn’t have to listen to Beyonce in the car. And of course we took the two hundred Euros and all the money that I had, though I was not really sure when would that come in handy. In my imagination, we would be driving though lands without a single soul, or even desserts. I didn’t look what the road to Walachei was like on Wikipedia. But I eventually knew it, when we were on our way.</p>

        <h3 id="18"><a href="#18" class="headerlink" title="18"></a>18</h3><p>I ran across the dark, narrow corridor, then turned left to the hallway with the iron handrail and creeped in with my back against the wall, the two tanks and the opened door in my sight. I saw Tschick running constantly and stopping at a corner, and I could tell how clueless he was, even from the back. But he ran like a fool, at least three minutes, without noticing me already behind him. He stood still on a empty field. I rose my shotgun high and hit him in the back. A stream of blood shot out of him, and he fell to the ground. “Shit.” he said, “Where the fuck are you? I can’t see a single thing.” I switched to chain gun, played around with his body and jumped in a circle.</p>
<p>“Great, man. Yeah, don’t overreact, dude.” Tschick pressed new game, but it was pointless. He didn’t plan the landing whatsoever. You could run behind him for hours, and he wouldn’t notice, and I killed him every time without an effort. I was a kind of world champion in Doom, and Tschick really didn’t know a single thing.</p>
<p>He grabbed himself a beer.</p>
<p>“And, if we drove away?” he asked.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“On vacation. We don’t have anything to do whatsoever. We could go on vacation like normal people.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Off with the Lada.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what <em>normal</em> people do.”</p>
<p>“But we could, or?”</p>
<p>“Nah. Press start.”</p>
<p>“Why though?”</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“If I beat you…” Tschick said, “Let’s say, if I beat you in five rounds. Or make it ten. Ten.”</p>
<p>“You’re not gonna kill me even if I gave you a hundred chances.”</p>
<p>“Ten it is.”</p>
<p>He really put an effort into it. I shoved a handful of chips in my mouth, waited until he picked up his weapon and let myself be shredded.</p>
<p>“Seriously.” I said, “Let’s do it.”</p>
<p>We almost spent the whole day doing nothing. We jumped in the pool twice. Tschick told me about his brother, and then he found the beer in the fridge and chumped down three cans. I also tried to drink one. I’ve tried a decent amount of beers before, but it never tickled my fancies, and not now either. I managed three quarters of the bottle. But it didn’t have an effect on me whatsoever.</p>
<p>“And if they catch us?”</p>
<p>“They’re not going to. And, if they wanted, they could’ve done it a million years ago and then the police would be here. They don’t have the slightest idea that the Lada is stolen. They saw us for ten seconds, at most, and they’re just gonna think it’s my brother’s.”</p>
<p>“Where do you want to go?”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>“If you wanna drive away, it’s not gonna hurt to have a destination.”</p>
<p>“We could pay a visit to my relatives. I have a grandfather in Walachei.”</p>
<p>“And where does he live?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, where does he live? In Walachei.”</p>
<p>“Around here or what?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Somewhere out there?”</p>
<p>“Not <em>somewhere</em> out there, man. In Walachei.”</p>
<p>“That’s the same though.”</p>
<p>“What’s the same?”</p>
<p>“Somewhere out there and Walachei, that’s the same.”</p>
<p>“I don’t get it.”</p>
<p>“That’s just a <em>word</em>, man.” I said and gulped down the rest of my beer. “Walachei is just a word! Kinda like BFE.”</p>
<p>“My family comes from there.”</p>
<p>“I thought you were from Russia?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but a part is from Walachei. My grandfather. And my great-grandfather and – what’s weird about it?”</p>
<p>“It’s like having a grandpa in BFE.”</p>
<p>“And what’s weird about that?”</p>
<p>“There is no BFE, dude! BFE means <em>Bumfunk Egypt</em>. And there’s also no Walachei. When you say someone lives in Walachei, it means they’re living in Pampa.”</p>
<p>“And there’s also no Pampa?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“But my grandpa lives there.”</p>
<p>“In Pampa?”</p>
<p>“You’re fucking crazy, seriously. My grandpa lives in a country called Walachei in this world, and we’re driving there tomorrow.”</p>
<p>He went serious, and I got serious too. “I know one hundred and fifty countries and their capitals.” I said and took a sip from Tschick’s beer, “There’s no Walachei.”</p>
<p>“My grandfather’s cool. He has two cigarettes in his ears. And only one tooth. I was there when I was five or something.”</p>
<p>“What are you exactly? Russian? Or Walacheian or what?”</p>
<p>“German. I have a passport.”</p>
<p>“But where you were born.”</p>
<p>“From Rostow. That’s in Russia. But our family comes from everywhere. West Germany, East Germany. And Switzerland, Walachei, Jewish gipsies…”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“What, what?”</p>
<p>“Jewish gipsies?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, man. And Walachen and…”</p>
<p>“No such thing.”</p>
<p>“What such thing?”</p>
<p>“<em>Jewish gipsies</em>. You’re saying shit. You’ve been saying shit the whole time.”</p>
<p>“Definitely wasn’t.”</p>
<p>“Jewish gipsies, that’s like English French! There’s no such thing.”</p>
<p>“Of course there are no English French.” Tschick said, “But there are Jewish French. And there are also Jewish gipsies.”</p>
<p>“Gypsy Jews.”</p>
<p>“Yes. And they go around Russia selling rugs with a thing on their heads. You can recognize them from the thing on their heads. A fag.”</p>
<p>“More like a fag on their ass. I don’t believe a single word.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you know this film with Georges Aznavour?” Now Tschick really wanted to explain.</p>
<p>“Films are films.” I said, “In real life, you can only be either Jew or Gypsy.”</p>
<p>“but Gypsy is’t a religion, dude. Jew is. Gypsy is someone who doesn’t have a place to live.”</p>
<p>“Those are berbers.”</p>
<p>“Berbers are carpets.” Tschick said.</p>
<p>I thought hard for a long time, and then when I finally asked Tschick whether he was <em>serious</em> about the Jewish Gypsy thing and he nodded, I believed him.</p>
<p>What I didn’t believe, was the shit with his grandpa. I already knew that Walachei was just a word. I proved to Tschick in a hundred ways, that Walachei didn’t exist, and I only made some progress when I made some exaggerated moves with my arms. Tschick did it again, and then he went and grabbed another beer and asked whether I wanted another one. But it didn’t tickle my fancies, and I wanted a cola.</p>
<p>Agitated, I saw a fly buzzing around the table. I had the impression that it was agitated as well, because I was agitated. I haven’t talked with someone like this in a long time. Tschick put two bottles on the table and said: “You’re gonna see it. My grandpa and my grandma and six cousins and the girls hot as fuck – you’re gonna see it.”</p>
<p>In fact, the thought slowly began to bother me. But as soon as Tschick had left, the cousins ​​and everything else dissolved into a fog and disappeared, and all that remained was a miserable feeling. A crying misery, almost. But that had nothing to do with Tschick. That had something to do with Tatjana. With the fact that I had no idea what she was thinking about me now, and that I might never find out, and at that moment I would have given a lot to be in Wallachei or anywhere else in the world but Berlin. </p>
<p>Before I went to bed, I opened my computer again. I found four emails from my father complaining that I had turned off my cell phone and that it wasn’t ringing downstairs either, and I had to think up some excuses for him and explain that everything was perfectly fine here. Which it was. And because I didn’t feel like receiving these emails and couldn’t think of anything, I typed “Wallachei” into Wikipedia. And then I <em>really</em> started to think about it.</p>

        <h3 id="17"><a href="#17" class="headerlink" title="17"></a>17</h3><p>“Seriously, you have to do something. If you don’t, you’re crazy. Let’s drive there. I don’t care if you think it’s awkward. There’s nothing more awkward than being in a broken Lada. Put on your super cool jacket, take you drawing and get your ass in the car.”</p>
<p>“Never.”</p>
<p>“We’re gonna wait until it’s dark, and then you’re gonna get your ass in the car.”</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“And why not?”</p>
<p>“I’m not invited.”</p>
<p>“You’re not invited! That, and? I’m also not invited. And do you know why? Logically, the Russian motherfucker isn’t. But do you know why <em>you</em> didn’t get invited? You see – you don’t know it. But I do.”</p>
<p>“Then say it, you genius. Because I’m boring and I look shitty.”</p>
<p>Tschick shook his head. “You don’t look shitty. Or maybe you do. But that’s not the point. The reason is: There’s no reason to invite you. You don’t stand out. You have to stand out, man.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by standing out? Come to school all drunk every day?”</p>
<p>“No. My god. but if I were you and looked like you and lived here and had your clothes, I would’ve gotten a hundred invites.”</p>
<p>“Do you need clothes?”</p>
<p>“Don’t chicken out. When it gets dark, we’re going to Potsdam.”</p>
<p>“Never.”</p>
<p>“We’re not going to the party. We’re just passing by.”</p>
<p>What a stupid idea. To be precise, it was three ideas, and every single one was stupid: Showing up without an invite, driving through Berlin with the Lada, and – the stupidest one – taking the drawing. Because one thing was clear: Tatjana would also figure out the thing with the drawing. I definitely didn’t wanna get things that far.</p>
<p>While Tschick tried to persuade me into going to Werder, I said unconvincingly that I didn’t wanna go. Then I said that we didn’t know the exact address, and then I swore that I wouldn’t get out of the car.</p>
<p>During the whole drive, I had my arms folded. This time, it wasn’t because of fingerprints, but because otherwise they would’ve trembled. Beyonce was on the dashboard in front of me and also trembling.</p>
<p>With all the emotions, I noticed that Tschick was driving more carefully than before. He chose the two-lane streets and got his foot off gas earlier when reaching a red light, so others wouldn’t look at us. We had to stop for a bit because it started raining and the windscreen wiper wasn’t functioning. But by then, we were almost out of Berlin. The car shook as if it were in an earthquake. But only for five minutes, only a thundery shower. After that, the air smelled really nice.</p>
<p>I looked through the wind shield, and I felt, for the first time, how strange it was to drive in a car that didn’t belong to you on the street. Suddenly, the red sun appeared under the black clouds. I didn’t say another word, and Tschick didn’t say anything either, and I was glad that he insisted on bringing me to a party which I really didn’t want to go. For three months I didn’t think of anything else – and it was happening now, and I would be the most ridiculous person in front of Tatjana.</p>
<p>The house wasn’t hard to find. We somehow found it when we were driving on the streets of Havel, but right in front of us, there were two mountain bikes with sleeping bags strapped on them – Andre and another dude. Tschick drove behind them with a rather safe distance in between, and then we saw the house. Blinking red, and the front lawn packed with bicycles. I crouched under my seat as Tschick rolled one of the windows open, put an elbow out and drove across the neighbourhood, speed eight and a half kilometers per hour. About a dozen people stood on the front lawn and by the front door. Countless in the back garden. Familiar and unfamiliar faces, girls from the other class piled with make-up. And in the middle, like a sun, Tatjana. She didn’t invite the Russian and the most boring, otherwise, she basically invited everything that could walk. The house slowly moved back behind us. No one saw us, and I suddenly realized that I didn’t plan how to give the drawing to Tatjana. At first, I considered throwing the drawing outside. Someone would eventually find it and give it to Tatjana. But before I could do something stupid, Tschick already parked and went out. I look at him going farther, frozen. I didn’t know if falling in love was so stupid, but I didn’t have any talent for it. While I was deciding on hiding under the seat and throwing the jacket on top of me or acting dead, a rocket shot from the blinking red house behind and exploded into red and yellow, and almost everyone ran to the back garden for the firework. Just Andre with his mountain bike and Tatjana, who came to greet him, were standing on the front lawn.</p>
<p>And Tschick.</p>
<p>Tschick was standing directly in front of them. They were staring at him, as if they didn’t know him. And maybe they really didn’t recognize him. Because Tschick had my sunglasses on. Other than that, he wore a pair of jeans that were mine and my grey jacket. We went through my closet and I gave him three pair of pants, a few shirts, a sweater and stuff, and now, he didn’t look like a Russian bitch anymore, he looked like he was from a fashion magazine. That wasn’t meant to be a compliment. But he didn’t look like himself anymore, and then he used a load of hair gel. I could see how he was talking to Tatjana and she answered – clearly irritated. Tschick made a gesture with his hand behind his back. I got out all hypnotized, and what happened after that – don’t ask me. I don’t know it anymore. Suddenly, I was standing next to Tatjana holding the drawing, and I’m pretty sure she was looking at me all irritated just like earlier with Tschick. But I didn’t see it whatsoever.</p>
<p>I said: “Here.”</p>
<p>I said: “Beyonce.”</p>
<p>I said: “A drawing.”</p>
<p>I said: “For you.”</p>
<p>Tatjana stared at the drawing, and before she could look at us again, I already heard Tschick saying: “Nope, don’t have time. We’ve still got other stuff.” He poked me, went back to the car, and I followed him – and the motored started and gone. I shoved my fist against the dashboard while Tschick switched to second and drove across the street.</p>
<p>“Shoud I show them again?” He asked.</p>
<p>I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Should I show them again?” Tschick asked.</p>
<p>“Do whatever the fuck you want!” I shouted. I felt so light.</p>
<p>Tschick fiddled with the steering wheel and the hand brake, and the car made a one-eighty turn on the street. I almost flew out of the window.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t always work.” Tschick said proudly. “Doesn’t always work.”</p>
<p>He flew past the blinking red house, and I saw from the corner of my sight, that they were still standing on the front steps. It was as if time stopped. Tatjana with the drawing in her hand, Andre with the mountain bike and Natalie, who’s just came from the back garden.</p>
<p>The Lada went through the next curve with sixty, and I punched the dashboard.</p>
<p>“More gas!” I shouted.</p>
<p>“As you said.”</p>
<p>“More!” I shouted.</p>

        <h3 id="16"><a href="#16" class="headerlink" title="16"></a>16</h3><p>For the whole time, I was waiting for his dad or his brother or someone else to get out, but then there were nobody. And as it turned out, there really was no one else in the car. The dirty wind shield made it difficult to tell.</p>
<p>“You look like a gay who’s been shitting on the garden for the whole night. Should I drive you somewhere, or do you wanna spray some more water?” He took out his brightest Russian grin. “Hop in, man.”</p>
<p>But naturally I didn’t get in. I wasn’t sure. I went halfway in and placed a part of my body on the seat.</p>
<p>The Lada looked even more horrible from the inside. Cables were hanging down the steering wheel, a screwdriver was in the dashboard.</p>
<p>“Are you out of your mind?”</p>
<p>“It’s just borrowed, not stolen.” Tschick said. “I’ll return it. We always did this.”</p>
<p>“We?”</p>
<p>“My brother. He found this thing lying on the street and it’s basically useless. You definitely could borrow it. The owner wouldn’t care whatsoever.”</p>
<p>“And that?” I pointed towards the cables.</p>
<p>“Can be fixed.”</p>
<p>“You’re crazy. And the fingerprints?”</p>
<p>“What about fingerprints? Are those the reason why you’re sitting so weird?” He shook my arm, which were folded in front of my chest. “Don’t freak out. That’s just some shit on TV. You can touch this. You can touch everything. Now, let’s get going.”</p>
<p>“Without me.” I looked at him and didn’t say anything else. He really was out of his mind.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you wanted to experience something yesterday?”</p>
<p>“By that, I didn’t mean prison.”</p>
<p>“Prison! You’re not criminally responsible.”</p>
<p>“Do whatever you want. But keep me out of it.” I, to be honest, didn’t know what was criminally responsible. I kinda knew it, but not exactly.</p>
<p>“Criminally responsible means: Nothing will happen to you. If I were you, I would rob a bank, my brother always says that. Till fifteen. My brother’s thirty. In Russian they beat the hell out of you – but here! Nobody cares, not even the owner.”</p>
<p>“No way.”</p>
<p>“Just around the block.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Tschick pulled the handbrake, and I, to be honest, didn’t know why I didn’t get out. I was a wimp. But at that moment, I didn’t want to be one anymore. His left foot stepped on the left pedal, and the Lada rolled backwards. Tschick stepped on the middle pedal, and the car stood still. A fiddle in the cable pile, the motor started, and I closed my eyes. When I opened them again, we were down on the road to Ketschendorf and turned right to street Rotraud.</p>
<p>“You didn’t turn on your blinkers.” I said meekly, with the arms still folded. I almost died out of excitement. Then I tried to find some safety.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be afraid. I drive like a world champion.”</p>
<p>“Then turn your blinkers on like one.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t done that for my whole life.”</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>“What for? The people see where I’m going. And there’s nobody anyway.”</p>
<p>That was right, the whole street was empty. And it was right for about a minute. Then Tschick got stared two times, and then suddenly, we were on the alley to the cosmonaut. It had four lanes. I was panicing out.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay. And please go back. Please.”</p>
<p>“Mika Haekkinen is no match for me.”</p>
<p>“You already said that.”</p>
<p>“Am I right or am I right?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Seriously. Didn’t my driving skills whoosh you off your feet?” Tschick asked.</p>
<p>“<em>Definitely</em> did.” I said, and somehow wanting to pay tributes to my mom’s standard answer to my dad’s standard question, I said: “Very good, darling.”</p>
<p>Tschick wasn’t driving like a world champion, but it wasn’t a catastrophy either. Not much better or worse than my dad. And in the end, he reached our area again.</p>
<p>“And could you follow a single rule? That’s a solid line there.”</p>
<p>“Are you gay?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I asked if you are gay.”</p>
<p>“Why so?”</p>
<p>“You said <em>darling</em>.”</p>
<p>“I had…what? That’s called irony.”</p>
<p>“So, are you gay?”</p>
<p>“Because of being ironic?”</p>
<p>“And because you’re not intersted in girls.” He looked deep into my eyes.</p>
<p>“Keep your eyes on the road!” I shouted, and I had to give in, I was turning a bit hysterical. He just drove without looking. My dad also used to do it, but that was my dad and he had a driver’s license.</p>
<p>“Everyone in the class is head over heels for Tatjana. Head over heels.”</p>
<p>“For whom?”</p>
<p>“Tatjana. We have a girl in the class and her name is Tatjana. You never noticed? Tatjana Superstar. You’re the only one who hasn’t looked at her. So, are you gay?”</p>
<p>I thought so hard, I almost died.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s bad.” Tschick said. “I have an uncle in Moscow who goes around wearing a pair of leather pants with a big hole on the ass. But other than that, it’s okay, my uncle. He works for the government. And he can’t do anything about the fact that he’s gay. I really don’t think it’s anything.”</p>
<p>Hammer. I also didn’t think it’s <em>bad</em> if someone is gay. But I’ve never had the impression that Russians run around with a hole on their pants. But I handle Tatjana Cosic like air, that was a joke, or? Because, <em>of course</em> I treat her like air. How else should I have reacted?</p>
<p>“You’re an idiot.” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m getting to the point. You’re not attracted to her.”</p>
<p>“Stop, that’s digusting.”</p>
<p>“My uncle –”</p>
<p>“Fuck your uncle! I’m not gay, dude. Didn’t you realize that I’ve been on a shitty mood?”</p>
<p>“Because I didn’t blink?”</p>
<p>“No! Because I’m not gay, you fool!”</p>
<p>Tschick looked at me with questions in his eyes. I didn’t want to explain. I didn’t wanna bring it up. I haven’t talked with anyone about it, and I didn’t want this to be a start.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand. Do I have to?” Tschick said. “You’re not gay because you suck at it or something? Heh?”</p>
<p>I merely looked out of the window. It didn’t matter if we stopped at a crossing and two retirees were staring at us throgh the wind shield, and then they would call the police. I kinda wished the police would take us. Then something would happen.</p>
<p>“So, a shitty mood – why?”</p>
<p>“Because today is <em>the day</em>, dude.”</p>
<p>“What kind of a day?”</p>
<p>“The party, you fool. Tatjana’s party.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to talk weird just because you’re sexually disorientated. You didn’t give a shit about it yesterday.”</p>
<p>“And even though I wanted to go.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a problem.” Tschick said, putting a hand on my knee. “I don’t care about your sexuality problem whatsoever, and I’m not gonna go further on it, I swear.”</p>
<p>“I can explain.” I said. “Should I?”</p>
<p>“Explain why you’re not gay? Nah-ah-ah.” He brushed invisible flies away.</p>
<p>At that point, we’ve already reachd our house. Tschick didn’t park directly in front of our house this time, but in a narrow alley, where no one could’ve seen us got out, and when we finally got to my room and Tschick looked at me as if he knew something about me, I said: “Don’t take me responsible for what you’re about to see. And don’t you dare laugh. If you laugh–”</p>
<p>“I won’t.”</p>
<p>“Tatjana is hard on Beyonce, you know that, right?”</p>
<p>“Yup. I would’ve stolen a CD for her if I were invited.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. So…that’s that.”</p>
<p>I got the drawing out of the drawer. Tschick took it, laid it out in front of him and stared at it. But he didn’t give as much attention to the drawing itself as to the backside, where I taped the rip neatly with clear duct tape, so you couldn’t see a thing from the front. He looked at the rip and the drawing again, and then he said: “You have feelings.”</p>
<p>He said that seriously, without any crap. That, I found impressive. And it was the first time I thought: He really isn’t dumb. Tschick saw the rip and immediately figured out what had happened. I’m pretty sure I don’t know a lot of people that can figure it out that quickly. Tschick looked at me seriously, and I liked that about him. He was someone that could blow you out of your mind, but if something serious came up, he could stop with the joking around and be serious.</p>
<p>“How long did it take you? Three months? That looks like a photo. And what do you plan to do with it?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>“You have to do something with it.”</p>
<p>“What should I do then? Should I go to Tatjana’s and say, happy birthday, I have a small gift for you – and I don’t mind that you didn’t invite me, yeah, seriously, no problem. And I just happened to stop by and I’ll go in a bit – have fun with the drawing on which I worked my ass off for three months?”</p>
<p>Tschick scratched his throat. He put the drawing on the desk again, looked at it for a bit, turned to me and said: “I would do exactly that.”</p>

        <h3 id="15"><a href="#15" class="headerlink" title="15"></a>15</h3><p>It turned somewhat better next morning. I waked up early just like on a schoolday, that unfortunately can’t be alternated. But the silence in the house reminded me: I’m alone, it’s summer vacation, the house is currently mine, and I can do whatever I want.</p>
<p>First, I started playing my CDs downstairs and moved the whole living room’s furniture. White Stripes. Then opened the balcony door, then laid by the poolside with three bags of chips and cola and my favorite book, and I tried to forget all the shit.</p>
<p>Though it’s still early, it’s at least thirty degrees here. I put my feet in the water, and Graf Luckner spoke to me. Because that’s my favorite book: Graf Luckner. I’ve read it for at least three times, but I thought a fourth time wouldn’t hurt. If someone is as dramatic as Graf, you could also make it five. Or ten. Graf Luckner is a pirate in the first world war and he sunk English ships one after another. And if that’s not enough, it’s all <em>gentlemanlike</em>. That means, he doesn’t go shitty on the people. He only dunks the ship and then bring all the passengers home. And the whole thing wasn’t made up, it’s real. The best part is in Australia. There, he acted as a lighthouse keeper and hunted kangaroos. I mean, he’s literally <em>fifteen</em>. He didn’t know anyone there. His ship crashed and he just happened to land on a lighthouse in Australia and hunt kangaroos. But I didn’t get that far this time.</p>
<p>The sun was rising, I put up the sunshade, and the wind was messing it up. I added some weight to its bottom. And then it was complete silence. But I couldn’t read. I was so excited from the “I can do what I want” thing, that I did absolutely nothing out of excitement. I’m different from Graf Luckner on this one. I imagined the whole thing with Tatjana again. Then I thought that the lawn needed some work. But my dad forgot about that, so I didn’t have to do it. But I did it anyway. It bothered me when I had to do it, but now, with me as basically the owner of the house and the garden <em>mine</em>, I found myself responsible for the lawn work. I stood barefoot on our front steps and sprayed all around with the yellow hose. I filled it up full, so the water shot up at least twenty meters in the air. But I didn’t reach the corners though I tried every trick to shoot further. Because, I definitely couldn’t go down the stairs anymore. That was a rule. In the living room, White Stripes was on full blast, the front door open, and me: holding up the hose high and barefoot, with sunglasses tucked in my hair, Graf Koks from the gas company was blowing up his estates. I could do this every morning! I also didn’t hate other people looking at this, but I didn’t see anyone most of the time. It was half past eight, and with the big vacation ahead, everyone’s sleeping in. Graf Koks was doing his chores alone – no, not completely. Jack and Meg, who, just like every other time, bothers him with their paparazzi shit, was paying a visit to his, and they were having a small jam session in the back room. Graf would join them in a bit and make some noise on the DJ table. The birds were chirping, the water was flowing…Koks of Klingenberg didn’t love anything more than this morning hour, in which he sprayed his lawn. He clicked the water button, waited a good ten seconds, filled it full and shot a super cool thirty meter rocket. In the cold, cold night, Meg White sang.</p>
<p>A flimsy car came down the street. It slowly reached our house and started parking. In an instance, the bright-blue Lada Niva was in our garage, and then the motor shut. The driver’s door opened, Tschick got out. He had his two elbows on the car lid and looked as I continued watering the lawn.</p>
<p>“Ah.” He said, and then didn’t say anything else for a long time. “Is that fun?”</p>
