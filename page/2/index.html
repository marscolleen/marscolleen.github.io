        <h3 id="16"><a href="#16" class="headerlink" title="16"></a>16</h3><p>For the whole time, I was waiting for his dad or his brother or someone else to get out, but then there were nobody. And as it turned out, there really was no one else in the car. The dirty wind shield made it difficult to tell.</p>
<p>“You look like a gay who’s been shitting on the garden for the whole night. Should I drive you somewhere, or do you wanna spray some more water?” He took out his brightest Russian grin. “Hop in, man.”</p>
<p>But naturally I didn’t get in. I wasn’t sure. I went halfway in and placed a part of my body on the seat.</p>
<p>The Lada looked even more horrible from the inside. Cables were hanging down the steering wheel, a screwdriver was in the dashboard.</p>
<p>“Are you out of your mind?”</p>
<p>“It’s just borrowed, not stolen.” Tschick said. “I’ll return it. We always did this.”</p>
<p>“We?”</p>
<p>“My brother. He found this thing lying on the street and it’s basically useless. You definitely could borrow it. The owner wouldn’t care whatsoever.”</p>
<p>“And that?” I pointed towards the cables.</p>
<p>“Can be fixed.”</p>
<p>“You’re crazy. And the fingerprints?”</p>
<p>“What about fingerprints? Are those the reason why you’re sitting so weird?” He shook my arm, which were folded in front of my chest. “Don’t freak out. That’s just some shit on TV. You can touch this. You can touch everything. Now, let’s get going.”</p>
<p>“Without me.” I looked at him and didn’t say anything else. He really was out of his mind.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you wanted to experience something yesterday?”</p>
<p>“By that, I didn’t mean prison.”</p>
<p>“Prison! You’re not criminally responsible.”</p>
<p>“Do whatever you want. But keep me out of it.” I, to be honest, didn’t know what was criminally responsible. I kinda knew it, but not exactly.</p>
<p>“Criminally responsible means: Nothing will happen to you. If I were you, I would rob a bank, my brother always says that. Till fifteen. My brother’s thirty. In Russian they beat the hell out of you – but here! Nobody cares, not even the owner.”</p>
<p>“No way.”</p>
<p>“Just around the block.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Tschick pulled the handbrake, and I, to be honest, didn’t know why I didn’t get out. I was a wimp. But at that moment, I didn’t want to be one anymore. His left foot stepped on the left pedal, and the Lada rolled backwards. Tschick stepped on the middle pedal, and the car stood still. A fiddle in the cable pile, the motor started, and I closed my eyes. When I opened them again, we were down on the road to Ketschendorf and turned right to street Rotraud.</p>
<p>“You didn’t turn on your blinkers.” I said meekly, with the arms still folded. I almost died out of excitement. Then I tried to find some safety.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be afraid. I drive like a world champion.”</p>
<p>“Then turn your blinkers on like one.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t done that for my whole life.”</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>“What for? The people see where I’m going. And there’s nobody anyway.”</p>
<p>That was right, the whole street was empty. And it was right for about a minute. Then Tschick got stared two times, and then suddenly, we were on the alley to the cosmonaut. It had four lanes. I was panicing out.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay. And please go back. Please.”</p>
<p>“Mika Haekkinen is no match for me.”</p>
<p>“You already said that.”</p>
<p>“Am I right or am I right?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Seriously. Didn’t my driving skills whoosh you off your feet?” Tschick asked.</p>
<p>“<em>Definitely</em> did.” I said, and somehow wanting to pay tributes to my mom’s standard answer to my dad’s standard question, I said: “Very good, darling.”</p>
<p>Tschick wasn’t driving like a world champion, but it wasn’t a catastrophy either. Not much better or worse than my dad. And in the end, he reached our area again.</p>
<p>“And could you follow a single rule? That’s a solid line there.”</p>
<p>“Are you gay?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I asked if you are gay.”</p>
<p>“Why so?”</p>
<p>“You said <em>darling</em>.”</p>
<p>“I had…what? That’s called irony.”</p>
<p>“So, are you gay?”</p>
<p>“Because of being ironic?”</p>
<p>“And because you’re not intersted in girls.” He looked deep into my eyes.</p>
<p>“Keep your eyes on the road!” I shouted, and I had to give in, I was turning a bit hysterical. He just drove without looking. My dad also used to do it, but that was my dad and he had a driver’s license.</p>
<p>“Everyone in the class is head over heels for Tatjana. Head over heels.”</p>
<p>“For whom?”</p>
<p>“Tatjana. We have a girl in the class and her name is Tatjana. You never noticed? Tatjana Superstar. You’re the only one who hasn’t looked at her. So, are you gay?”</p>
<p>I thought so hard, I almost died.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s bad.” Tschick said. “I have an uncle in Moscow who goes around wearing a pair of leather pants with a big hole on the ass. But other than that, it’s okay, my uncle. He works for the government. And he can’t do anything about the fact that he’s gay. I really don’t think it’s anything.”</p>
<p>Hammer. I also didn’t think it’s <em>bad</em> if someone is gay. But I’ve never had the impression that Russians run around with a hole on their pants. But I handle Tatjana Cosic like air, that was a joke, or? Because, <em>of course</em> I treat her like air. How else should I have reacted?</p>
<p>“You’re an idiot.” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m getting to the point. You’re not attracted to her.”</p>
<p>“Stop, that’s digusting.”</p>
<p>“My uncle –”</p>
<p>“Fuck your uncle! I’m not gay, dude. Didn’t you realize that I’ve been on a shitty mood?”</p>
<p>“Because I didn’t blink?”</p>
<p>“No! Because I’m not gay, you fool!”</p>
<p>Tschick looked at me with questions in his eyes. I didn’t want to explain. I didn’t wanna bring it up. I haven’t talked with anyone about it, and I didn’t want this to be a start.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand. Do I have to?” Tschick said. “You’re not gay because you suck at it or something? Heh?”</p>
<p>I merely looked out of the window. It didn’t matter if we stopped at a crossing and two retirees were staring at us throgh the wind shield, and then they would call the police. I kinda wished the police would take us. Then something would happen.</p>
<p>“So, a shitty mood – why?”</p>
<p>“Because today is <em>the day</em>, dude.”</p>
<p>“What kind of a day?”</p>
<p>“The party, you fool. Tatjana’s party.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to talk weird just because you’re sexually disorientated. You didn’t give a shit about it yesterday.”</p>
<p>“And even though I wanted to go.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a problem.” Tschick said, putting a hand on my knee. “I don’t care about your sexuality problem whatsoever, and I’m not gonna go further on it, I swear.”</p>
<p>“I can explain.” I said. “Should I?”</p>
<p>“Explain why you’re not gay? Nah-ah-ah.” He brushed invisible flies away.</p>
<p>At that point, we’ve already reachd our house. Tschick didn’t park directly in front of our house this time, but in a narrow alley, where no one could’ve seen us got out, and when we finally got to my room and Tschick looked at me as if he knew something about me, I said: “Don’t take me responsible for what you’re about to see. And don’t you dare laugh. If you laugh–”</p>
<p>“I won’t.”</p>
<p>“Tatjana is hard on Beyonce, you know that, right?”</p>
<p>“Yup. I would’ve stolen a CD for her if I were invited.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. So…that’s that.”</p>
<p>I got the drawing out of the drawer. Tschick took it, laid it out in front of him and stared at it. But he didn’t give as much attention to the drawing itself as to the backside, where I taped the rip neatly with clear duct tape, so you couldn’t see a thing from the front. He looked at the rip and the drawing again, and then he said: “You have feelings.”</p>
<p>He said that seriously, without any crap. That, I found impressive. And it was the first time I thought: He really isn’t dumb. Tschick saw the rip and immediately figured out what had happened. I’m pretty sure I don’t know a lot of people that can figure it out that quickly. Tschick looked at me seriously, and I liked that about him. He was someone that could blow you out of your mind, but if something serious came up, he could stop with the joking around and be serious.</p>
<p>“How long did it take you? Three months? That looks like a photo. And what do you plan to do with it?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>“You have to do something with it.”</p>
<p>“What should I do then? Should I go to Tatjana’s and say, happy birthday, I have a small gift for you – and I don’t mind that you didn’t invite me, yeah, seriously, no problem. And I just happened to stop by and I’ll go in a bit – have fun with the drawing on which I worked my ass off for three months?”</p>
<p>Tschick scratched his throat. He put the drawing on the desk again, looked at it for a bit, turned to me and said: “I would do exactly that.”</p>

        <h3 id="15"><a href="#15" class="headerlink" title="15"></a>15</h3><p>It turned somewhat better next morning. I waked up early just like on a schoolday, that unfortunately can’t be alternated. But the silence in the house reminded me: I’m alone, it’s summer vacation, the house is currently mine, and I can do whatever I want.</p>
<p>First, I started playing my CDs downstairs and moved the whole living room’s furniture. White Stripes. Then opened the balcony door, then laid by the poolside with three bags of chips and cola and my favorite book, and I tried to forget all the shit.</p>
<p>Though it’s still early, it’s at least thirty degrees here. I put my feet in the water, and Graf Luckner spoke to me. Because that’s my favorite book: Graf Luckner. I’ve read it for at least three times, but I thought a fourth time wouldn’t hurt. If someone is as dramatic as Graf, you could also make it five. Or ten. Graf Luckner is a pirate in the first world war and he sunk English ships one after another. And if that’s not enough, it’s all <em>gentlemanlike</em>. That means, he doesn’t go shitty on the people. He only dunks the ship and then bring all the passengers home. And the whole thing wasn’t made up, it’s real. The best part is in Australia. There, he acted as a lighthouse keeper and hunted kangaroos. I mean, he’s literally <em>fifteen</em>. He didn’t know anyone there. His ship crashed and he just happened to land on a lighthouse in Australia and hunt kangaroos. But I didn’t get that far this time.</p>
<p>The sun was rising, I put up the sunshade, and the wind was messing it up. I added some weight to its bottom. And then it was complete silence. But I couldn’t read. I was so excited from the “I can do what I want” thing, that I did absolutely nothing out of excitement. I’m different from Graf Luckner on this one. I imagined the whole thing with Tatjana again. Then I thought that the lawn needed some work. But my dad forgot about that, so I didn’t have to do it. But I did it anyway. It bothered me when I had to do it, but now, with me as basically the owner of the house and the garden <em>mine</em>, I found myself responsible for the lawn work. I stood barefoot on our front steps and sprayed all around with the yellow hose. I filled it up full, so the water shot up at least twenty meters in the air. But I didn’t reach the corners though I tried every trick to shoot further. Because, I definitely couldn’t go down the stairs anymore. That was a rule. In the living room, White Stripes was on full blast, the front door open, and me: holding up the hose high and barefoot, with sunglasses tucked in my hair, Graf Koks from the gas company was blowing up his estates. I could do this every morning! I also didn’t hate other people looking at this, but I didn’t see anyone most of the time. It was half past eight, and with the big vacation ahead, everyone’s sleeping in. Graf Koks was doing his chores alone – no, not completely. Jack and Meg, who, just like every other time, bothers him with their paparazzi shit, was paying a visit to his, and they were having a small jam session in the back room. Graf would join them in a bit and make some noise on the DJ table. The birds were chirping, the water was flowing…Koks of Klingenberg didn’t love anything more than this morning hour, in which he sprayed his lawn. He clicked the water button, waited a good ten seconds, filled it full and shot a super cool thirty meter rocket. In the cold, cold night, Meg White sang.</p>
<p>A flimsy car came down the street. It slowly reached our house and started parking. In an instance, the bright-blue Lada Niva was in our garage, and then the motor shut. The driver’s door opened, Tschick got out. He had his two elbows on the car lid and looked as I continued watering the lawn.</p>
<p>“Ah.” He said, and then didn’t say anything else for a long time. “Is that fun?”</p>

        <h3 id="14"><a href="#14" class="headerlink" title="14"></a>14</h3><p>Until the Vietnamese came. She comes normally three times a week. She’s really old, somewhere around sixty, I would say, but when it comes to speaking, she definitely doesn’t match her age. She passed me without a word, went into the kitchen and came out again with a vacuum cleaner. I just looked at her for a while before telling her that she didn’t have to work for the next two weeks. I just wanted to be alone. I told her that my parents were out and it’s enough if she just came at the Tuesday fourteen days later to clean up the house. But it was terribly hard to let her accept it. I thought the vacuum would fall out of her hand immediately out of joy, but that wasn’t the case. She didn’t believe me at first. So I showed her around the house and what my dad bought me and the circled Wednesday on the calender, which was when he would come back, and because she still didn’t believe me, I even showed her the two hundred euros he left. And then it became clear to me why she wouldn’t let go of the vacuum cleaner. Because she thought she wouldn’t get paid anymore. Seriously weird. It wouldn’t make any difference with the money, I said. But she understood it with great difficulty, because she couldn’t speak German, and then she finally got it, when we pointed our fingers at the Tuesday on the calender and looked at each other in the eye and nodded together, and then that was it. I still don’t know how I’m supposed to communicate with these people. We also used to have an Indian for the garden, who’s now fired because of cost issues, but he was the exact same. Weird. I want to handle them like normal people, but they take themselves as workers who work their ass off for money, and they are exactly that, but I’m only fourteen. My parents don’t mind it. And when my parents are there, I don’t have any trouble with it too. But I felt like Hitler when I was alone with the Vietnamese in a room. I really wanted to take the vacuum from her and do the cleaning myself.</p>
<p>I accompanied her out, and I would like to give her something as a figt, but I didn’t know what, so I just winked at her like a total dumbass and was really happy when I was alone. I put the tools, which were still lying all over the place, away, and then I stood in the warm evening air and breathed in and out.</p>
<p>The Dyckerhoffs were grilling on the other side of the street. The oldest son winked at me with the grilling tongs in his hand, and because he is an asshole like all of our neighbours, I quickly looked to the other side, and there came a bike down the street. It was two different wheels and a rotten piece of leather on a frame for a women’s bicycle. There was a brake for an accessory, which was bent like an antenna. There was a small basket in the back and Tschichatschow was on it. That was the last person I wanted to see after my dad. Except for Tatjana, anyone was basically the last person I wanted to meet. But the look on the Mongolian face made it immediately clear that the feeling was not mutual. “Kawock!” said Tschick, beaming, and headed for the sidewalk next to us. “Do you think what happens: I drive over there - it goes kawock. Do you live here? Hey, is that repair kit? How cool is that, give it to me.” I didn’t feel like arguing. So I gave him all the tools and said he should just put them back there afterwards. I didn’t have time, I had to go. Then I went straight into the house and listened for a while through the closed door to see if anything was happening outside, if he was perhaps running off with the tools, and finally I lay down in my room again and tried to think about something else. But that wasn’t so easy. Downstairs, you could hear the clatter of tools the whole time, a lawn was being mowed, and someone was singing in Russian. Singing badly in Russian. And when it finally got quiet around the house, it worried me even more. I looked out the window and saw someone walking through our garden. Tschick walked all the way around the swimming pool, stopped at the aluminum ladder, shaking his head, and scratched his back with a wrench. I opened the window. “Great pool!” Tschick shouted, beaming up at me. “Yeah, great pool. Great jacket, great pool. And now?” He just stood there. So I went downstairs and we chatted a bit. Tschick was absolutely thrilled about the pool, he wanted to know how my father earned his money, and I explained it to him, and then I wanted to know how he pulled the plug on that Ford guy in three jumps, and he shrugged his shoulders. “Russian mafia.” He grinned, and at that point I knew that it had nothing to do with the mafia. But I couldn’t figure out what it had to do with either, although I kept trying for a while. We just talked and in the end it happened as it had to and we ended up in front of the PlayStation playing GTA. Tschick hadn’t heard of that yet and we weren’t very successful, but I thought: Still better than lying in the corner screaming. “And you really didn’t repeat a year?” he asked at some point. “I mean, have you looked in now? I don’t understand. You’re on vacation, man, you’re probably going on vacation, you can go to this party and you have a wonderful -“ “What party?” “Aren’t you going to Tatjana’s?” “No, I don’t feel like it.” “Seriously?” “I have other plans tomorrow,” I said, frantically pressing the triangle.</p>
<p>“Besides, I’m not invited.”</p>
<p>“You’re not invited? That’s crazy. I thought I was the only one.”</p>
<p>“It’s boring anyway,” I said, and drove over a few people with the tanker truck.</p>
<p>“Yes, for gays maybe. But for people like me who are still in their prime, this party is a must. Simla is here. And Natalie. And Laura and Corinna and Sarah. Not forgetting Tatjana. And</p>
<p>Mia. And Fadile and Cathy and Kimberley. And the super-sweet Jennifer. And the blonde from 8a.</p>
<p>And her sister. And Melanie.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” I said, looking dejectedly at the TV. Tschick also looked dejectedly at the TV.</p>
<p>“Let me have the helicopter,” he said, and I gave him the controller, and then we didn’t talk about it any more. When Tschick finally went home, it was almost midnight. I heard the bike squeaking away towards Weidengasse, and then I stood alone in front of our house in the night for a while, the stars above me. And that was the best thing about that day: that it was finally over.</p>

        <h3 id="13"><a href="#13" class="headerlink" title="13"></a>13</h3><p>I stood for a bit. I didn’t want to go home just yet. I didn’t want today to be a normal day just like every other one. It was a special day. An especially bitter day. I really needed some time.</p>
<p>When I opened the door, nobody was there. A note was on the table: <em>There’s food in the fridge.</em> I got my things out, scanned through my report card real quick, put the Beyonce CD on and crawled under my bed sheets. I couldn’t say whether the music comforted me or just made me more depressed. I’m pretty sure it just depressed me more.</p>
<p>I went back to school a couple of hours later to pick up my bicycle. Seriously, I forgot my bike. My way to school was two kilometers, and sometimes I go on foot, but I didn’t on this day. I was so deep in my thoughts when Tschick babbled, that I simply unlocked my bike, locked it again and went on. Real misery there.</p>
<p>I went by the big sand hill and the playground for the third time today. I sat on the Indian tower there. A tall tower, which they built there for kids to play Cowboy and the Indian, as if there were kids here. At least I’ve never seen any. Also no teens or adults. Not even the homeless sleep there. Only I sit on the tower now and then, where I can see absolutely nobody. Looking to the east, the tall houses of Hellersdorf could be spotted, north ran a line of shrubs and bushes, and somewhere back there is a small garden colony. But there were absolutely nothing around the playground, really a deserted land, which had been under construction before. There should’ve been houses there, which you can still read from a big, weathered, fallen-down sign near the street. White walls with red roofs, trees and next to that the writing: <em>Here are 96 single-family-houses.</em> Under that are the rent information, and at the bottom is <em>Immobilen Klingenberg</em>.</p>
<p>But one day, three dead insects, including a frog and a rare grasshopper, were discovered on this field, and then the environmentalists went against the construction company and the construction company against the environmentalists, and the field remained deserted. The process was already running for ten years, and if you believed my dad, it would continue on for another ten years, because the eco-fascists haven’t started growing plants on there. eco-fascist is a word that my dad created. Sometimes he even drops the eco part, because they’ve ruined him with this act. One quarter of the land belonged to him, and they turned it into shit. If a stranger happened to stay at our house for lunch, they definitely won’t understand a single word. My dad only talked about shit, fascists and motherfuckers for years. How much effort he actually spent on the thing and how it would affect us, I didn’t know for a long time. I always thought that my dad would somehow make it work, and maybe he’s thought about it himself also. But then he just quit and sold his part. He used to spend a whole load of time on it, but he was determined with the idea that if he went on with the process, it’ll just take him more, and so he sold all the stuff way under its worth to the <em>motherfucker</em>. For now, that’s used for referencing his colleagues. The motherfuckers that continued on. That was a few years ago. And it was clear a year later: our holiday was ruined, and the house, which once belonged to us, maybe would not belong to us anymore or maybe even hasn’t been ours for some time. My dad said. And all that because of three dead insects and a grasshopper.</p>
<p>The only one that stood the storm was the playground, which was built from the very start, to show that the neighbourhood was kid-friendly. Now that’s definitely spoiled.</p>
<p>And okay, I give up, there’s another reason why I go over here all the time. Because when you’re on the tower, you could see two white rental houses. They’re over there behind the small garden colony, somewhere behind the trees, and Tatjana lives in one of them. I don’t know exactly, but there’s a small window on the upper left corner, and the owner would always have a green light lit, and I just assumed that it’s Tatjana’s room looking at the green light. So sometimes I sit on the Indian tower and wait for the green light. When I come back from our football training or from the afternoon class, I’ll look through the woods and carve out letters on the wood with my key, and when the light lights up, I feel warm in my heart, and when it doesn’t, it’s always a huge disappointment.</p>
<p>But it was too early on this day, and I didn’t wait, so I went to school. There stood my bike, all alone in the kilometer-lang parking section. There was nobody in the building. Only the janitor was taking two trash cans to the street. A Cabrio playing Turkish hip-hop went by. And it’s gonna stay like this for the rest of the summer. Six weeks without school. Six weeks without Tatjana. I already saw myself spending a load of time at the Indian tower.</p>
<p>Back home, I didn’t really know what I shoud do. I tried to repair the lamp on my bike, which was broke for a long time, but I didn’t have soem of the compartments. I put on <em>Survivor</em> and started refurnishing my room by moving my bed up front and my desk to the back. Then I went down again and fiddled with the lamp some more, but it was useless, and I just threw the tools in the garden and went upstairs, threw myself in my bed and started screaming. That was the first day of vacation, and I was already cracking up. I got the Beyonce drawing our. I looked at her for a long time, held her with two hands and started ripping her very slowly. When I reached Beyonce’s vorhead, I stopped. What that was, I don’t have a single idea. I only remember that I somehow ran out of the house and into the forest and up the hill, and then I started jogging. I didn’t really jog, I didn’t have my sport things on, but I passed about twenty joggers per minute. I just ran across the forest and screamed, and everyone else who was also running in the forest really got me on my nerves, because they could <em>hear</em> me, and then I came across someone who was taking a walk with ski stockings on, he was really missing some goggles, and I really would’ve kicked him in the ass for his shitty stockings.</p>
<p>I stood for hours under the shower at home. Then I felt a bit bitter, kinda like a shipwreck who’s been on the Atlantics for weeks, and then a cruise came and someone threw a can of Red Bull and then I got going again. Like that.</p>
<p>The door rang.</p>
<p>“What’s the stuff lying out there?” My dad shouted.</p>
<p>I tried to ignore him, but it was hard.</p>
<p>“Should those just lie there?”</p>
<p>He meant the tools. So I went downstairs after I checked whether my eyes were still red in the mirror, and as I got down, a taxi driver was standing at the door.</p>
<p>“Go down there and say goodbye to your mother.” My dad said, “Did you already do that? You didn’t remember it, or? quick, go! Go!”</p>
<p>He pushed me down the stairs. I was a bit angry. But, unfortunately, my dad was right. I completely forgot the thing with my mom. I remembered it for the last few days, but because of the excitement today, I forgot. My mom’s going to the clinic for four weeks.</p>
<p>She sat in her bedroom, wearing a coat, in front of the mirror, and she dressed up. I helped her with her suitcase. My dad brought it to the taxi, and just as the taxi started, he called her, as if he cared about her. but that was not the case, as it came out later. My mom wasn’t even gone for half an hour, and my dad came into my room and had the “I’m your father and we need to talk about serious shit” face on. It made me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He looked like this when he wanted to talk about sex with me a few years ago. He also had this face, when he told me because of his allergy to cat hair, he has to send not only our cat, but also my two rabbits and the turtle away. And he looked just like this now.</p>
<p>“I’ve been informed that I have a business appointment.” He said that, as if he would be troubled by it. He frowned a lot. He explained a bit, but it was really simple. He wanted to leave me alone for two weeks.</p>
<p>I made a face that should say that I need to think carefully about the deal. Could I do it? Fourteen days alone in this environment with only swimming pools, pizzas and video games? Yeah, probably, I nodded, I could try. I would figure something out.</p>
<p>The serious face relaxed for a bit.</p>
<p>“And don’t you fuck things up! Though I don’t think you would. I’ll leave you two hundred euros here, they’re already in the drawer downstairs, and if something happens, call immediately.”</p>
<p>“In the middle of your business stuff.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my <em>business stuff</em>.” He looked a bit angry.</p>
<p>He called my mom a few times in the afternoon, and as he was calling her, his assistant came to pick him up. I came down immediately to see whether it was the same one. This assistant looks really good and she’s only a few years older than me, about nineteen maybe. And she always laughs. She laughs a lot. I met her for the first time two years ago, when I was visiting my dad in his office, and then she rubbed my hair and laughed, when I tried to not let my whole body collapse onto the printer. Unfortunately, she doesn’t do that anymore, with the hair rubbing.</p>
<p>She got out of the car in shorts and a tight sweater, and it became clear what kind of a business trip it would be. The sweater was so tight that you could basically see every little detail. I thought it was okay that my dad didn’t even try to make a big fuss about it. It wasn’t necessary. It was clear between my parents. My mom knew what my dad was up to. And my dad knew what my mom was up to. And when they were alone, they would scream at each other.</p>
<p>What I didn’t get for a long time is, why they didn’t divorce. I thought I was the reason for a while. Or the money. But at some point, I came to the conclusion that they just like screaming and shouting at each other. That they like to be unhappy. I’ve read it in a magazine somewhere: there are people who like being unhappy. That means they are happy when they are unhappy. I have to say, I didn’t quite get it. Something about it troubles me, but something about it clears out my questions.</p>
<p>And I still haven’t managed to find a better explanation for the thing going on with my parents. I really thought a lot about it, I even got a serious headache because of it. It’s kinda like those 3D pictures, where you have to squint at a pattern of some sort, and suddenly you see something crazy. Other people could do a better job with that than me, I’ve almost never experience that, and in the moment, when I see something crazy, like a flower or a deer or something, it immediately disappears, and I would then catch a headache. And it’s the exact same with thinking about my parents, and I get headaches because of it. So I don’t think about it anymore.</p>
<p>When my dad packed his stuff, I talked with Mona downstairs. Her name is Mona, the assistant, and the first thing she said to me was how warm it was and how it was gonna get warmer for the next few days. Practical stuff. But when she realized I’ll have to spend my vacation alone, she looked so sad. Leaving your parents and god and the world! I thought about begging her to rub my hair again, like that time by the printer. But I didn’t do it. But I just stared at the landscape and tried to avoid the sweater, and listened to Mona complimenting my dad. I guess being older really does have some advantages.</p>
<p>I was still deep in my landscape observation when my dad came down the steps with his stuff.</p>
<p>He said the same stuff that he told me earlier for the third time, where he put the money, and then he had his arm around Mona’s waist and went into the car with her. He could’ve spared the part. With the hand on her waist, I mean. I found it nice that she didn’t react too much to it. But when she was on our property, there was no need to put an arm around her waist. Person opinion. I shut the door, closed my eyes and stood still for a minute.</p>
<p>“Mona!” I cried. My throat tightened. “I have to confess something to you!” My voice echoed frighteningly in the empty vestibule, and Mona, who seemed to have already suspected that I had to confess something to her, held her hands over her mouth in horror. Her sweater rose and fell in agitation. </p>
<p>“Oh God, oh God!” she cried. </p>
<p>“Don’t get me wrong,” I sobbed, “I would never volunteer to work for the CIA! But they have us in their hands - do you understand?” And of course she understood. She collapsed next to me, crying. “But what are we supposed to do?” she cried desperately. </p>
<p>“There’s nothing we can do!” I answered. “We can only play along with their game. The most important thing is to keep up the facade. You always have to remember that I am an eighth-grader now and I look like an eighth-grader and that we are just going to carry on with our lives as normal, at least for another year or two, as if we don’t even know each other!” </p>
<p>“Oh God, oh God!” Mona cried, clutching my neck and sobbing. “How could I have doubted you?” </p>
<p>“Oh God, oh God!” I cried, and I pressed my forehead to the cold tiles and curled up on the floor and cried for about half an hour. After that I felt better.</p>

        <h3 id="12"><a href="#12" class="headerlink" title="12"></a>12</h3><p>But I have to tell you about Tatjana’s birthday now. Tatjana’s birthday is in the middle of our summer vacation, and there was supposed to be a huge celebration. Tatjana said that a long time ago. It seemed like her fourteenth birthday was going to be celebrated and Potsdam and everyone’s going to be invited and there’s even a sleepover and stuff. She also made sure her girlfriends would be there, because of course they would want to be there. And because Natalie was going to be on vacation with her parents on the third day of the summer holiday, the whole party had to be moved to the second day, and so it was really early.</p>
<p>This house in Potsdam was Tatjana’s uncle’s and it faced the sea directly, and this uncle basically wanted to entrust Tatjana with the house, there will be no grown-ups besides him, the celebration will go on throught the night, and everyone was supposed to bring sleeping bags.</p>
<p>That was a hot topic in class even wekks before, and I started to imagine myself discussing stuff with this uncle. I don’t know anymore why does he fascinate me so much, but I thought that he had to be an interesting guy to just leave the house to Tatjana and plus the fact that he’s her relative, and I really looked forward to knowing him. I already had a vision of me standing in the living room by the fireplace with him and having some super conversations. Even though I didn’t know whether there was a fireplace in the house. But I wasn’t the only one that was excited because of the party. Julia and Natalie were thinking about gift ideas like a century ago, you could tell it from the notes they’ve passed in class through many others. That means, I could read it, because I sat on the line between Julia and Natalie, and I was of course interested in gift ideas because I’ve also been thinking about nothing but what to give Tatjana at her birthday. Julia and Natalie, it was already clear, were going to buy her the new Beyonce CD. Julia gave Natalie a list to check, it looked somewhat like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Beyonce</em></li>
<li><em>Pink</em></li>
<li><em>the headband with the (unrecognizable)</em></li>
<li><em>add more</em></li>
</ul>
<p>And Natalie checked the first one off. Everyone knew that Tatjana loved Beyonce. I had a little trouble with that at first, because I find Beyonce shit, at least the music. But she looked great, she even had a few common grounds with Tatjana, and because of that, I started thinking that Beyonce wasn’t so shit some time on. On the other hand, I started to like Beyonce, and I eventually liked the music at some point. No, that’s not right. I thought the music <em>super</em>. I even bought her two newest CDs and listned to them on loop, while I thought about Tatjana and what present I should get her. Something from Beyonce, a definite pass. Because obviously there’s going to be more that think of it other than Natalie and Julia, and then Tatjana would get like thirty Beyonce CDs and could trade twenty-nine of them. I wanted to give her something special, but I couldn’t think of any, but as I saw this list, something popped up.</p>
<p>I went to a newspaper stand, bought a relatively expensive magazine with Beyonce’s face on the cover and started drawing it. I drew squares with a ruler on the original picture. And then I took a huge piece of paper and drew squares that were five time the size. That’s a method that I learned from a book. <em>Old mister</em> or something. With this trick, you could turn a small picture into a huge drawing. You just do it a square to a square. Of course you could’ve just used a printer to copy it, but I wanted it to be hand-drawn. I wanted others to see that I put effort into this. Because, if others see I put effort, they could also think about other things. I worked on this drawing for weeks. I really worked hard. Only with a pencil, and I feel more turned on, because all I could think about was Tatjana and her birthday and her uncle, with whom I was going to throw some awesome conversations by the fireplace.</p>
<p>And I’ll admit, I can’t really do a lot, but I could draw. Kinda like the thing with high jumping. If drawing Beyonce and high jumping were the most important subjects on planet earth, I would be far ahead. Seriously. But unfortunately nobody gives a shit about high jump, and I kinda got bored of drawing. After four weeks’ worth of hard work, Beyonce looked almost like a photo, a huge pencil drawing of Beyonce with Tatjana’s eyes, and I would be the happiest person on earth, if I could get an invite to Tatjana’s party. But I didn’t get any.</p>
<p>It was the last day of school, and I was kinda nervous, because this whole thing with the party was heated, everyone was talking about Potsdam, but there were no invites, or at least I didn’t see any. And we didn’t have a single idea about where her uncle’s house was. I had the map in my head. And so I thought that Tatjana was gonna give some out at the last day of school. But that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>But, I saw a small green card in Arndt’s bag. That was during math. I saw how Arndt showed Kallenbach the card and Kallenbach frowned, and I could see a little map on the card. And then I realized that everyone had this small green card. Well, almost everyone. Kallenbach didn’t get any either, stupid as he looked, but he always looked stupid. He was stupid. That was also the reason why he wasn’t invited. Kallenbach looked at the writing closely, he had myopia but somehow never wears glasses, and Arndt put the thing away and in his bag again. As it turned out later, I and Kallenbach weren’t the only ones without invitations. The Nazi also, Tschichatschow too, and then one or two more. Logically. The most boring people and the Asians weren’t invited, Russians, Nazis and idiots. And it didn’t took me a long time to know what I was in Tatjana’s perspective. Because, I was neither a Russian nor a Nazi.</p>
<p>But other than that, basically the whole class was invited, and then half of the class next to us and another hundred people, and I wasn’t.</p>
<p>Till the last session, and after the grades were given, I still kept my hopes up. I hoped that it was just a mistake, that Tatjana would come to me after the bell and she would say: “Psycho, man, I totally forgot about you! Here is the green card! I hope you have time, because it would really make me happy – and I hope you didn’t forget about my present? Yeah, always no prob with you! Well, see you then, I’ll be really looking forward to your appearance! I almost forgot about you, my god!” Then the bell rang, and everyone went home. I packed my stuff extra slowly to give Tatjana the last chance to notice her mistake.</p>
<p>There were only dicks and geniuses standing in the hallway, talking about their grades and other random stuff, and at the exit – twenty meters to the exit, someone gave a pat on my shoulder and said: “Super cool jacket.” It was Tschick. You could see two big rows of teeth when he was grinning, and the slit eyes were narrower as usual. “I’ll buy it. The jacket. Just wait a bit.”</p>
<p>I didn’t wait, but I heard him running after me.</p>
<p>“Favorite one.” I said, “Not for sale.” I found the jacket at Humana and bought it for five euros, and it really was my favorite jacket. It had some Chinese elements to it, and with a white dragon monster on the chest, which looked really cheap. But still great. Others would say it’s the perfect fit for Asians. But I liked it because of that, because others couldn’t see that I was the direct opposite of an Asian on first sight: rich and defenceless.</p>
<p>“Where are they? Hey, stop! Where are you going?” He shouted through the whole hallway. It kinda looked like he had something other than alcohol.</p>
<p>“Did you fail a year?”</p>
<p>“Why were you shouting like that?”</p>
<p>“Did you fail a year?”</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“You look like it.”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“Like you failed a year.”</p>
<p>What did he want from me? I caught myself thinking it was great that Tatjana didn’t invite him.</p>
<p>“But all Fs.” He said.</p>
<p>“No idea.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean no idea? If I make you nervous, report it.”</p>
<p>I should report that he annoyed me? And then I get a punch in the face or something?</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know if I annoy you?”</p>
<p>“If I got all Fs.”</p>
<p>“Seriously?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t check yet.”</p>
<p>“Your report card?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t check your report card?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Really? You got your report card and didn’t look at it? How cool is that then.” He made some moves with his arms when he was speaking, and he was next to me, and, to my surprise, he wasn’t taller than me, just stronger.</p>
<p>“And you’re not selling the jacket?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“And what are you doing now?”</p>
<p>“Go home.”</p>
<p>“And then?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>“And then?”</p>
<p>“None of your fucking business.” Now that I realized he wasn’t trying to rip me off, I immediately became braver. Unfortunately, that’s always the case. As long as people are unfriendly, I can hardly walk because I’m so excited. But if they become even a little bit friendly, I always start insulting them. Tschick walked beside me in silence for a few hundred meters, then he tugged on my sleeve, repeated that it was an extremely cool jacket, and slid sideways into the bushes. I saw him stomping across the meadow towards the high-rise buildings, the plastic bag that was his school bag slung over his right shoulder.</p>

        <h3 id="11"><a href="#11" class="headerlink" title="11"></a>11</h3><p><em>“A man that didn’t see Mr. K for a long time greeted him with the following words: ‘You haven’t changed a single bit.’ - ‘Oh.’ Mr. K said and blanched.</em> That was a short story.” Kaltwasser closed the work, took off his jacket and threw it on his chair. Kaltwasser was our German teacher, and he always came in class without any greetings, or, at least, you don’t hear them, because by then, he’s already started with his class, at this point, he hasn’t even stepped through the door yet. I have to say that I don’t really get Kaltwasser. Kaltwasser is, apart Wagenbach, the only one that gives ok-ish classes, but, as Wagenbach is a total asshole, still has somewhat humanity, just because of that, you can’t get too bad out of him. Or at least I don’t. He comes in like a machine and starts talking, and then straight 45 minutes, and then he goes out again, and you don’t really know what you’re supposed to do. I can’t say if I find him nice or not. Others have agreed that Kaltwasser is as nice as a pile of shit, but I really don’t know. I could even say he’s pretty good.</p>
<p>“Rather short.” Kaltwasser repeated. “And they definitely thought about it, I can even get the interpretation though the short story. But then you still have to write clearly: It’s not as easy as you think. Or does someone think it’s easy? Who wants to go then? Volunteer? Na, come. The last row interests me.” We followed Kaltwasser’s sight to the last row. Tschick sat there with his head on the table, and you couldn’t really tell, whether he was  all up in his book or just sleeping. It was the sixth session.</p>
<p>“Mr. Tschichatschow, if I may?”</p>
<p>“What?” Tschick’s head slowly raised. This ironic tone. The alarms should be triggered by now.</p>
<p>“Mr. Tschichatschow, are you there?”</p>
<p>“Did you do your homework?”</p>
<p>“By myself.”</p>
<p>“Would you like to read it to us?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah.” Tschick sat back again, found his plastic bag on the floor, raised it high and looked for his work. As usual, he didn’t prepare before the session. He took out several booklets and tried to identify the right one.</p>
<p>“If you didn’t do your homework, just say it.”</p>
<p>“I have it – where isit though? Where isit though?” He put one on the table, shoved the others back and flipped through the pages.</p>
<p>“There, there it is. Should I start?”</p>
<p>“If you could <em>please</em> start.”</p>
<p>“Ok, I’m gonna start now. The homework was about the story of Mr. K. I’ll begin. Interpretation of the story of Mr. K. The first question that comes up when you read Precht’s story, logically–”</p>
<p>“Brecht.” Kaltwasser said. “Bert Brecht.”</p>
<p>“Ah.” Tschick managed to find a pen in his plastic bag and scribbled something on his booklet. He threw the pen in the bag again.</p>
<p>“Interpretation of the story of Mr. K. The first question that comes up when you read Brecht’s story, logically, is that it’s a man who doesn’t want light on him. He is hiding behind a letter, namely the letter K. That is the eleventh letter of the alphabet. Why is he hiding? Mr. K. is actually a professional arms dealer. Together with other shady characters (Mr. L. and Mr. F.) he founded a criminal organization for which the Geneva Convention is nothing more than a sad joke. He has sold tanks and airplanes and made billions and has long since stopped getting his hands dirty. He prefers to cruise on his yacht in the Mediterranean, where the CIA came across him. Mr. K. then fled to South America and had his face surgically altered by the famous doctor M. and is now astonished that someone recognizes him on the street: he turns pale. It goes without saying that the man who recognized him on the street, just like the facial surgeon, was standing in incredibly deep water with a concrete block on his feet a short time later. Done.” </p>
<p>I looked at Tatjana. She had a frown on her face and a pencil in her mouth. Then I looked at Kaltwasser. There was absolutely nothing to be seen on Kaltwasser’s face. Kaltwasser seemed slightly tense, but more interested and tense. Nothing more, nothing less. He didn’t give a grade. Afterwards Anja read the correct interpretation, as it is on Google, then there was an endless discussion about whether Brecht had been a communist, and then the lesson was over. And that was just before the summer holidays.</p>

        <h3 id="10"><a href="#10" class="headerlink" title="10"></a>10</h3><p>We got our first math work back two weeks later. Strahl always writes our grades on the board beforehand to create tension. This time, there was an A, that, was impossible. Strahl’s favorite saying is: A is only for the god. But Strahl was also our math teacher and he was disturbing. There were two Bs, countless Cs and Ds, and a single F. I kinda wished for the A, math was the only subject in which I could land a goal now and then. But then I got a B minus. Always. With Strahl, a B minus is almost an A. I turned around to see where the cheers (because of the A) were. But nobody cheered. Neither Lucas or Kevin, not the other math tryhards. But Strahl had the last one in the hand and personally brought it to Tschichatschow in the last row. Tschick sat there and chewed on peppermint gum. He didn’t look at Strahl and only continued chewing and breathing. Strahl weighed himself down, opened his lips and said: “Andrej.”</p>
<p>There was almost no reaction. A small turn of the head like a gangster in a film, behind which a click of a weapon can be heard.</p>
<p>“Your work. I don’t know what it is…” Strahl said and put a hand on Tschick’s desk. “I mean, if you didn’t learn it at your previous school – you have to re-do it. You didn’t – you didn’t even try.” Strahl flipped through the pages and his voice sank, but you could still understand him. “This joke – I mean, if you didn’t have it, I completely understand. I had to give you an F, but they are in parenthesis. I would suggest you ask Kevin or Lucas for help. You can give your homework to them. Stuff from the last two months. And when you have questions. Because, if not, this won’t do.”</p>
<p>Tschick nodded. He nodded with surprisingly understanding, and then it happened. he fell from the chair, direct in front of Strahl’s feet. Strahl twitched, and Patrick and Julia jumped up. Tschick was lying on the ground as if he were dead.</p>
<p>We’ve been with this Russian for a bit, but nobody would think he’d fall from a chair because of an F in math. As it later came out, it had nothing to do with it. He didn’t eat anything for the whole morning, and with the alcohol, it was obvious. Tschick puked a whole sink in the secretary’s office, and then he was sent home.</p>
<p>What he wrote in his work was unclear, and I also forgot who got the A. But what I’ve always remembered and will never forget, is Strahl’s face when he saw a Russian fall to his feet.</p>
<p>The irritating thing about this story was not Tschick’s falling from the chair or his getting an F. The irritating thing was, that he got a B three weeks later. And then a D. And then a B again. Strahl was a total different person. He said something from “good revision” to “not behind now”, but even blind people could see that the Bs had nothing to do with Tschick’s good revision or what. It was only because he cheated sometimes and sometimes not.</p>
<p>So, as time went on, the teachers also got hold of that, so Tschick was warned and sent home for a few times. There were also talks with him in private, but the school didn’t take it seriously. Tschick always had a heavy fate or so what, and because after the PISA-test everyone wanted to know whether the Asian, pickled Russian stood a chance at a German high school, he never got any real penalties. After some time, the whole thing with Tschick started to cool down. What’s up with him, still knows nobody. But he did catch up in most subjects. He chewed fewer peppermint gum in class. And he hardly disturbed. If he didn’t have his occasional dropout, maybe you would even forget his existence.</p>

        <h3 id="9"><a href="#9" class="headerlink" title="9"></a>9</h3><p>I couldn’t ignore Tschick from the very start. Nobody could. Tschick was an Asien, and he looked like it. Wagenbach dragged him into class after Easter, and when I say he dragged him, I mean it. First session after Easter: history. Everyone tacked on their chairs, because, if there’s an authentic asshole, it’s Wagenbach. But I would say asshole is an overstatement, actually, Wagenbach is ok. His classes are ok and at least not dumb like the most, for example Wolkow. You don’t need to concentrate on Wagenbach’s classes. And you can still do good on it, because, Wagenbach really can tear one apart. Everyone knows that. Even those who haven’t met him. Before a five-grader enters class, they already know: watch out for Wagenbach! With him, it’s total silence. With Schuermann, there will be at least five phone rings during one session. Patrick even managed to set a new ring tone on his class — that’s six, seven, eight tones one after another, until Schuermann asked for a little silence. And he didn’t do him either. But with Wagenbach, if a phone rings, the owner can’t reach recess alive. There are rumors that Wagenbach used to keep a hammer on his desk to smash phones. I don’t know if that’s true.</p>
<p>Wagenbach came in with his ugly suit on and his brown bag under his arm just as usual, and behind him dragged this boy, who reminded me of a coma. Wagenbach put his bag on the table and turned around. He waited with a frown, until the boy finally got in, and said: “We have a new classmate. His name is Andrej —”</p>
<p>And then he looked at his notepad, and then he looked at the boy again. It was clear that the new student should’ve said his name. But the boy stared at the middle aisle into nothingness and didn’t say a single word.</p>
<p>And maybe it’s not important to write about what I thought when I saw Tschick for the first time, but I’m gonna say it anyway. I had a really bad feeling when he stood beside Wagenbach there. Two assholes on a stage, I thought, even though I didn’t know him at all and didn’t know whether he was an asshole. He was Russian. He was middle height, wore a muddy white shirt which had a missing button, 10 euro jeans from Kick and brown, not in shape shoes that looked like dead rats. Other than that, he had high cheek bones and slits for eyes. These slits are the first thing you see about him. Looked like a Mongolian , and you never know where he’s looking. His mouth was slightly opened on one side, it looked as if an imaginary cigarette can be tucked in there. His arms were strong and had a huge scar. His legs relatively thin and his head rough-edged. Nobody giggled. Not when it’s Wagenbach’s class. But I had a feeling that without Wagenbach, still no one would giggle. The Russian simply stood there and looked somewhere with his Mongolian eyes. And he completely ignored Wagenbach. That was practically impossible.</p>
<p>“Andrej,” Wagenbach said, stared at his notepad and moved his lips silently. “Andrej Tsch … Tschicha … tschorff.”</p>
<p>The Russian mumbled something.</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Tschichatschow.” The Russian said without sparing a glance at Wagenbach.</p>
<p>Wagenbach fiddled his nostrils with the air. That was an iconic move of him. Nostrils in the air.</p>
<p>“Great, Tschischaroff, Andrej. Do you want to introduce yourself to us? Where you come from, what your previous school is?”</p>
<p>That was standard. When new students came into class, they had to say where they came from and things like that. And now, Tschick’s the first exception. He turned his head to the side, as if he’s just noticed Wagenbach at this moment. He scratched his throat a bit, turned himself back to the class and said: “No.” Somewhere, a needle dropped to the floor.</p>
<p>Wagenbach nodded stiffly and said: “You don’t want to say where you come from?”</p>
<p>“No.” Tschick said. “Doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>“Okay then. Then I’m gonna do the favor, Andrej. I have to introduce you to the class out of politeness.”</p>
<p>He looked at Tschick. Tschick looked at the class.</p>
<p>“I take your silence as consent.” Wagenbach said.</p>
<p>And he said it in an ironic tone, just like every other teacher when they say something similar.</p>
<p>Tschick didn’t answer.</p>
<p>“Or do you oppose?” Wagenbach asked.</p>
<p>“You can start.” Tschick said and gestured with his hand.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the girl’s block, a giggle came out. You can start! Insane. He pronounced every syllable individually with a really strange accent. And he still stared at the back wall. Maybe he even shut his eyes. It was hard to tell. Wagenbach made a face that asked for silence. Though it was already completely quiet.</p>
<p>“So…” he said, “Our new classmate’s name is Andrej Tschicha…schoff. And we can tell from his name that our guest comes from the vast Russian land, which Napoleon robbed from the east — and soon returned, as we’ll see today. Just like Karl the seventh before him. And Hitler after him.”</p>
<p>Wagenbach fiddled with his nostrils again. The movement didn’t make any impression on Tschick. He didn’t react.</p>
<p>“Andrej came to Germany with his brother four years ago, and – don’t you want to say it yourself?”</p>
<p>The Russian made a sort of noise.</p>
<p>“Andrej, I’m speaking to you.” Wagenbach said.</p>
<p>“No.” Tschick said. “I don’t want to tell it.”</p>
<p>Giggles. Wagenbach nodded squarely.</p>
<p>“Ok then, I’ll say it if you don’t oppose, it’s strangely weird though.”</p>
<p>Tschick shook his head.</p>
<p>“You don’t think it’s unnormal?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Well, I find it strange.” Wagenbach emphasized. “And also surprised. But to make it short – we’re gonna shorten it a bit here. Our friend Andrej comes from a German family, but his mother tongue is Russian. He is a formulator, as we can see, but he’s just learned German in Germany and should earn our understanding in certain…areas. He entered a special school four years ago. Then switched to a secondary school because his grades allowed him to do so, but he didn’t stay for long. Then another secondary school, and now he’s with us, and all that in just four years. So far all correct?”</p>
<p>Tschick rubbed his nose with his hand, then he fiddled a bit with them. “Ninety percent.” He said.</p>
<p>Wagenbach waited for more. But nothing more. The other ten percent remained unknown.</p>
<p>“Well then.” Wagenbach said, surprisingly friendly. “And we’re obviously very excited about what comes next…but you can’t stand here for a whole day, it was very nice to talk to you. I would suggest you sit at the desk at the back, because it’s the only free one. Right?”</p>
<p>Tschick went through the middle aisle like a robot. Everyone looked at him. Tatjana and Natalie had their heads together.</p>
<p>“Napoleon!” Wagenbach said and made a dramatic pause in order to take out a pack of paper tissues from his bag and blow his nose with it. Tschick was halfway, and on the trail he came, there was a smell that almost blew me away. An alcohol smell. I sat three seats from the aisle and still could put together his drink list for the last twenty-four hours. My mother smelled like that when she had a bad day, and I thought, maybe that was the reason why he didn’t look at Wagenbach the whole time and hardly opened his mouth, because of the smell. but Wagenbach caught a cold. He couldn’t smell anything whatsoever.</p>
<p>Tschick sat at the last free desk way back. Kallenbach sat here at the start of the year, the class bully. But when it became clear that he’s just gonna disturb everyone 24-7, Mrs. Pechstein switched him to the first row after a few days so she could have some control over him. And now, this Russian was sitting here, and I wasn’t the only one that had the feeling that Mrs. Pechstein wasn’t gonna approve of it. He was a different type of bully, that was obvious, so they constantly turn to him. After his meeting with Wagenbach, everyone knew: something’s gonna happen, and it’s getting intense.</p>
<p>But then nothing happened for the whole day. Tschick was greeted by every teacher and had to spell his name in every session, but other than that, total silence. Also the next few days, it was really a surprise. Tschick always came to school with his wrinkled shirt, doidn’t make any noise during class, always said “Yes” or “No” or “I don’t know” when he was called, and that was it. He didn’t make friends with anyone, and he didn’t even try to do so. He didn’t stink of drinking anymore, but still, whenever you looked into the back row, you always had the impression that he had somehow passed out. The way he sat there slumped over with his slit eyes, you never knew: was he sleeping, was he a bitch, or was he just very laid back?</p>
<p>But after then, it stinked once a week. Not so bad as the first time, but always once a week. There are some of us that have already drunk before - I don’t belong to that - , but stinking like that on the next day, that was new. Tschick would always chew mint gum, so you could always tell which phase he was in.</p>
<p>Other than that, we really didn’t know a lot about him. The fact that he had been in a special school and then came here was absurd enough. And then this clamot. But there are people that defend him, they said that at least he wasn’t dumb at the end of the day. “At least he’s not as stupid as Kallenbach”, I said sometime, because I was one of them. But I defended him, to be honest, only because Kallenbach was standing there and he got me on my nerves. You couldn’t really tell from Tschick’s speech, whether he was genius, or stupid, or something in between.</p>
<p>And obviously there were rumours about his past. From Siberia, from Moscow – everyone said something different. Kevin said Tschick lived in a camping car with his brother somewhere near Hellersdorf, and this brother of his was a weapon smuggler. Someone else knew that he was a raper, and they lived in a 40-room-villa which belonged to the Russian mafia, and also someone said he lives in a tall house facing the North See. But, to be honest, those were just rumours, and they only spread because Tschick hardly talked to anyone. And so he slowly got forgotten. Or at least as forgotten as you can be if you show up every day in the same bad shirt and cheap jeans and sit in the class idiot’s seat. The shoes made of dead animals were at least replaced by white Adidas, which someone immediately knew were freshly stolen. And maybe they were. But the number of rumors stopped increasing. They just invented the nickname Tschick, and for everyone who found that too easy, he was called the special needs student, and then the Russian topic was over for the time being. In our class, at least. </p>
<p>It took a little longer in the parking lot. In the mornings, the senior students stood in the parking lot in front of the school, and there were a few who already had cars, and they found this Mongolian incredibly interesting. Guys who had been stuck five times and leaned in the open driver’s door of their car so that everyone could see that they were the owners of these tuned junk cars, and they made fun of Tschick. “Are you scoundrels again, Ivan?” And that happened every morning. Especially one guy with a yellow Ford Fiesta. For a long time I didn’t know whether Tschick noticed that they were talking about him and that they were laughing at him, but at some point he stopped. I was busy locking up my bike and I heard them making bets loudly about whether Tschick would hit the door to the school building, the way he was swaying - they said: how the damn Mongol sways - and Tschick stopped and went back to the parking lot and towards the boys. All of them were a head taller and a few years older than him and they were grinning like crazy at the way the Russian arrived - and walked past them. He headed straight for the Ford guy, who was the loudest of all, put his hand on the driver’s door and spoke to him so quietly that no one else could hear him, and then the grin slowly disappeared from the Ford guy’s face and Tschick turned around and went into school. From that day on, they didn’t call after him anymore. </p>
<p>I wasn’t the only one who had seen this, of course, and after that the rumors that Tschick’s family was really the Russian mafia or something like that never died down, because no one could imagine how else he had managed to completely pull the plug on the Ford idiot in three sentences. But logically, that was nonsense. Mafia, utter nonsense. That’s what I thought, anyway.</p>

        <h3 id="8"><a href="#8" class="headerlink" title="8"></a>8</h3><p>There are many things I can’t do. But when I can do something, then it’s high jump. I mean, I’m not an Olympics athlete or something, but I’m unbeatable in high jump and long jump. Even though I’m one of the shortest, but I can jump as high as Olaf, who is one meter ninety tall. I set a record for our junior high earlier this year, and I was very proud. We were on the high jump field, and the girls were sitting over there on the grass, and Mrs. Beilcke was giving them a lecture. That’s their PE class: Mrs. Beilcke gives them a literal lecture and they sit there scratching their ankles. They also don’t run all over the field like Wolkow.</p>
<p>Wolkow is our PE teacher, and he also likes to give lectures. Every PE teacher that I’ve seen likes to spit out an unbelievable amount of words. With Wolkow, Mondays are for bundesliga, Tuesdays mainly also bundesliga, Wednesdays champion’s league and Fridays come the joyful anticipations of bundesliga and the analytics. In summer, Wolkow can also give out some opinions about the Tour de France, but it’s mostly about doping and quickly back to more important topics, why you don’t dope in football. Because it doesn’t have any use. That’s Wolkow’s true thoughts. And that hasn’t interested anyone so far, but the problem is: Wolkow only talks when we are jogging on the field. He’s in super conditions, he’s definitely seventy, but is immer briskly ahead and keeps chattering and chattering. And then he always says: “Men!” And he says nothing for the next ten meters and then: “Dortmund.” Ten meters. “Can’t handle it.” Ten meters. “Home record. Am I right?” Twenty meters. “And van Gaal, the old fox! It’s no walk.” Param, param. “Any thoughts?” A hundred meters. And obviously no one’s gonna say anything, because we’ve already ran twenty kilometers, and only Hans, the Nazi, the team captain, the one who’s behind us all sweaty and out of breath, sometimes shouts: “Ha-ho-he! Hertha BSC!” And then it’s too much for Wolkow himself, Wolkow the Babbler, and he skipped an extra turn so taht Hans can catch up, and then he raises his index finger and shouts with his trembling voice: “Simunic! Joe Simunic!”</p>
<p>And only that can get one excited about high jump. Maybe we only did high jump on that day, because Wolkow had an extremely sore throat and couldn’t jog and babble at the same time, but only jog. When Wolkow had a middle level sore throat, he babbles a bit less. When he’s dead, class is cancelled. But when he comes down with a bad sore throat, he just jogs quietly around the field.</p>
<p>He records our jumps in his little black notebook during high jump and always compares them with the numbers from the last year and says that we’re five centimeters higher before. The girls sat near the field, just like I’ve said, and listened to Mrs. Beilcke. But actually they obviously didn’t listen to her, but they’re looking at us.</p>
<p>Tatjana was at the back with her best friend Natalie. They were whispering. And I sat as if I were on burning coal. I seriously wanted to come up before Mrs. Beilcke finished her babbling. Wolkow also started the competition just on time: First one meter twenty, whoever didn’t pass was out. Then five centimeters higher each time. Only Heckel got eliminated on one twenty. Heckel has a fat tummy, he’s already had that since year five, and to match it, two sticks for legs. It’s not really a surprise that he couldn’t jump a single centimeter off the ground. He isn’t especially good in any subjects, but he sucks especially in PE. He’s also dyslexic, that means his spelling errors in German essays don’t count. So he can make as many mistakes as he wants. Only the contents and the style counts, because it’s a disease and he can’t do anything about it. But then I have a question, what can he do about his stick legs? His father is a bus driver and looks just like him: A ton with two sticks. It’s clear that Heckel is also a high jump dyslexic, and how high he reached shouldn’t count, still only the content. But it’s not a known disease, so he’s still horrible at PE, and all girls giggled when the fat lump threw himself forward and landed in the face.</p>
<p>By one forty, the field was starting to clear up. By one fifty, there were only Kevin and Patrick, Andre with a good amount of effort, and obviously me. Olaf was sick. When Andre threw himself over the bar, girls starting cheering, and Mrs. Beilcke looked serious. When it came to one fifty-five, Natalie screamed: “You’re gonna make it, Andre!” A very stupid encouragement, because he’s definitely not gonna make it. On the other hand, he flew under the bar, which often happens in high jump when you tilt too much to the front. He rolled under and tried to save it with a joke. But it was too old. No one laughed. Next up, they cheered Kevin on. Kevin the math genius. But he also didn’t pass one sixty. And then there was only me. Wolkow put a sixty-five on, and I already knew it during the sprinting, it was my day. It was the day of Maik Klingenberg. I had this feeling of triumph when I was jumping. But I didn’t jump, I sailed over the bar like a plane, I floated in the air, I hovered. Maik Klingenberg, the athlete. I think, if I could give myself a nickname, it would be aerofloat. Or air Klingenberg. But unfortunately you’re not allowed to give yourself nicknames. As my back sank into the soft mat, I heard a few handclaps on the boys’ side. And complete silence on the girls’. When I bounced up again, I first looked at Tatjana, and Tatjana was looking at Mrs. Beilcke. Natalie also. They didn’t see my jump wahtsoever. It didn’t interest them, what the psycho sleeping pill was doing. Aerofloat my ass.</p>
<p>It really made the day for me, even though I wasn’t that interested in it. Like high jumping could interest me for a milisecond! But if Andre came over a one sixty-five or even tried one, the girls were gonna run around the field waving pom-poms. And they didn’t spare a single look at me. I didn’t interest anyone. If I managed to interest anything, then the question: Why weren’t anybody looking at air Klingenberg acing the school record, and why did everybody look at a flour bag roll under the bar? That was a shit of a school, and that was a shit of a girl, and there were no other. I always thought that, until I knew Tschick. And then something changed. And I’m gonna tell you about it right now.</p>

        <h3 id="7"><a href="#7" class="headerlink" title="7"></a>7</h3><p>And after that, I’ve been called psycho. For a year long. Even in class. Even, when the teacher was there. “Go, psycho, play! You can do it, psycho! Nice catch!” And it finally stopped when Andre came into our class. Andre Langin. The beautiful Andre.</p>
<p>Andre was popular. He made a girlfriend in our class on the first day, and then he switched every single week, and now he’s with a Turkish girl, who looked like Salma Hayek, from the class next to us. He also got close to Tatjana for a bit, that, was different for me. They chatted with each other for a few days, in the hallway, in front of the school gate, even in classes. But I believe they didn’t get together after all. Because, from some point on, they didn’t talk to each other anymore, and then I heard, just like how Andre Patrick said, how men and women don’t fit together, really scientific stuff from the stone age. And I hated him because of it. I hated him from the very first moment, but it wasn’t easy. Because, he’s not the brightest candle right now, but he’s also not hollow. He can be nice, and there’s something laid-back about him, and his looks, just like I’ve said, are really good. But he’s still an asshole. He only lives a street away from us, in the Wald Street 15. Where only assholes live. The Langins have a huge house there. His father is a politician or something like that. And my dad said: Big man, this Langin! Because he’s also in the FDP right now. </p>
<p>But I actually wanted to say something else. When Andre first came to us, we went hiking somewhere south from Berlin. A practical trip to the woods. I was far behind everyone and enjoyed the nature. Because, we had a herbarium back then, and I was interested in nature for a while. In trees. I wanted to be a scientist or something. But not long, and then came the thing with the trip, where I wandered behind the others, and looked at the habitats and the environment in peace. Then I realized that I didn’t give a shit about leaves and habitats and stuff. Laughter came from the front, and I could tell the laugh of Tatjana Cosic apart, and two hundred meters behind them, Maik Klingenberg was studying a load of leaves in the nature. Wasn’t really nature, just some pathetic wood, with three warning signs every ten meters.</p>
<p>We eventually stopped at a three hundred year old white beech, which was planted by a Frederick the Great, and the teacher asked who knew what kind of a tree that was. And nobody knew. Except me of course. But I wasn’t really hyped that I knew it was a white beech out of all those people. I could’ve said it: My name is Psycho, and I have a problem. Simply the fact that we were standing around the tree and no one knew its name was depressing enough. And I’m getting to the point slowly. This Frederick the Great also was generous enough to set up a few benches under the tree, so you could sit there and have a picnic, and we did exactly that. I sat at the same table as Tatjana. I was across from Andre, the pretty Andre, both arms over the shoulders of Laura and Marie. As if they were great friends, but only as if. He’s only about a week in our class. But the two weren’t against it. On the other side, they were really honored and didn’t dare to move a milimeter, like they were afraid they could scare his arms away. And Andre said nothing for the whole time, only looked across with his sleepy look, and then he looked at me again and said this after thinking for a long time: “Why is he called psycho? He’s totally boring.” Laura and Marie laughed for the joke, and because that was such a success, he repeated it again: “Really, why is the sleeping pill psycho?” And after that I’m Maik again. And it’s even more horrible than before.</p>
