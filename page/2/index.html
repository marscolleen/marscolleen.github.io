        <h3 id="6"><a href="#6" class="headerlink" title="6"></a>6</h3><p>And I still haven’t explained why they called me psycho. Because, just like I’ve said, I’ve been called psycho for a bit. No idea what that’s supposed to mean. But one thing is clear: It means I didn’t get along with all of them. But in my opinion, there are some that could also be called that. Frank could’ve, or Stöbcke with his lighter, they’re definitely a lot more disturbing than me. Or the Nazi. But the Nazi is already Nazi, they don’t really need another name. And of course there’s a special reason for me to have this nickname. This reason was from Schuermann during German essays in the sixth class. The theme was keyword-prompted essay. Just in case someone doesn’t know what that is, these essays go like this: you get four words, for example “zoo”, “monkey”, “waiter” and “hat”, and then you have to write something with these four words. Very original. All that stuff. The words that Schuermann came up with were “vacation”, “water”, “rescue” and “god”. It’s definitely doubled in difficulty compared to the zoo and the monkey, and the main difficulty was obviously god. Aside from Ethik, and sixteen atheists including me, and also those who protested, they didn’t really believe god. At least I believe. At least not in the way people who believed in god believed it is, who couldn’t hurt an ant and are really happy when one dies because they’ll go to heaven. Or those who drive a plane and crash it into the World Trade Center. They really believed god. So this task was extremely hard. Most people started with the word vacation. Small families going to Côte d’Azur, surprisingly meets a horrible storm face to face and scream “oh god” and get saved and stuff. I could’ve also written something of the kind. But when I sat there fore this task, I felt, in the first hand, that we didn’t go on holidays for the last three years, because my dad’s always planning his bank robs. It didn’t disturb me a bit, I really don’t want to go on vacation with my parents either.</p>
<p>I chose to stay in the basement and carve boomerangs. A teacher of mine from the primary school taught me how to do it. He’s a total expert in the field of boomerangs. His name was Bretfeld. Wilhelm Bretfeld. He even wrote a book about it. Maybe two. But I only found that out when I was out of primary school. But after that, I met good old Bretfeld on the lawn again. He was practically standing on the cow lawn behind our house and was throwing his boomerangs, hand-carved boomerangs – and that was something I didn’t know worked. I only thought it would appear on screen. But Bretfeld was the total professional, and then he showed me all about it. I found that somehow exciting. Also because he carved and painted that all by himself. “Everything that’s round on the fornt and sharp in the back can fly.”,he said, and then he looked at me through his glasses and asked: “What’s your name again? I don’t remember you.” What surprised me the most, was this long-flying-boomerang. That was one of his own creations, they could fly for minutes, and he founded that. Across the world, when someone throws a long-flying-boomerang and it keeps flying for five minutes in the air, then a picture will be taken, and on it: based on a design by Wilhelm Bretfeld. He is therefore practically world famous, this Bretfeld. And he was standing behind out house last summer and showing me all about that. Really a good teacher. I didn’t notice it when I was in primary school.</p>
<p>So, I sat in the basement for the whole summer and carved boomerangs. And that was a great summer vacation, a lot better than going on a holiday. My parents were almost never at home. My dad was busy going from creditors to creditors, and my mom was on the beauty farm. And I wrote about that in my essay: my mom and the beauty farm. Keyword-prompted essay from Maik Klingenberg.</p>
<p>I was allowed to read on during the next hour. or I had to. I didn’t want to. Svenja was first, and he read all this shit with the Côte d’Azur, which Schuermann found really great, and then Kevin read the same thing but with the North See, and then came me. My mom on the beauty farm. It wasn’t really a beauty farm. Even though my mom did look better every time she came back. But it’s a clinic. She’s alcoholic. She’s been drinking for as long as I can remember, but the difference is, it was a fun thing before. Alcohol made everyone funnier, but when you pass a certain border, people turn tired or aggressive, and when my mom ran across the apartment with the kitchen knife again, I stood on the steps with my dad, and he asked: “How about the beauty farm again?” And then the summer began, when I was in year six. I love my mom. I have to say that, because, what’s about to come, might throw shade on hre. But I’ve always loved her, and I still love her. She’s not a typical mom. That’s what I like most about her. She can be, for instance, very humourous, most moms can’t do that. And the name beauty farm was a joke my mom made up. </p>
<p>Earlier on, my mom played a lot of tennis. My dad also, but not so good. When my mom was still fit, she won the club championship every year. And she also won them with a bottle of vodka drunken, but that’s another story. Every time I, at that time a kid, was on field with my mom, she would always sit on the club terrasse and drink cocktails with miss Weber and Mrs. Osterthun and Mr. Schuback and the others. And I sat under the table and played with cars, and the sun shined brightly. In my memories, it was always sunshine at the tennis club. I saw five pairs of white tennis shoes, I saw the underwear under the short tennis skirts, and I collected the corks that fell from above. I was allowed five ice-creams, ten colas per day. And then Miss Weber says from above: “Next week at seven again, miss Klingenberg?”</p>
<p>And my mom: “Of course.” And miss Weber: “I’ll bring the balls.”</p>
<p>And my mom: “Of course.”</p>
<p>And so on. Always the same conversation.</p>
<p>But here and there, there was another entertainment. It went like this:</p>
<p>“Next week on Saturday, miss Klingenberg?”</p>
<p>“I can’t, I’m out of town.”</p>
<p>“But your husband has a game?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, he won’t leave. I’m going.”</p>
<p>“Ah, where are you going then?”</p>
<p>“To the beauty farm.”</p>
<p>And then always, always, always, someone who didn’t know that would come to the table and say this deliberately: “That’s obviously not necessary for you, miss Klingenberg!” and my mom would tilt her Brandy Alexander and say: “Good joke, Mr. Schuback. It’s an alcoholic clinic.”</p>
<p>Then we would return home hand in hand, because my mom couldn’t drive the car anymore. I carried her heavy sport bag, and she said to me: “You can’t learn a lot from your mother. But you can learn these from her. First, you can talk about anything here. And second, don’t give a fuck about what others think.” That excited me. Freedom of speech. And crap on everyone.</p>
<p>Arguments came later. Not really an argument principally. But an argument about whether my mom really gave a fuck about it.</p>
<p>This beauty farm. How it works exactly, I don’t know. Because I’m not allowed to visit my mom, she doesn’t want that. But when she’s back from it, she always said some crazy things. Therapy mainly consisted of zero alcohol and talking. And water treading. Sometimes also gymnastics. But gymnastics can’t do much. They just chatted most of the time and threw a ball of thread all over the place. Because, who had the ball, had the permission to speak. I had to ask five times, whether I heard correctly or is that some sort of a joke with the ball. But that’s no joke. My mom didn’t find it funny or exciting, but I found it, to be honest, surprisingly exciting. You’d have to imagine it: Ten grown-ups sitting in a circle and throwing a ball of thread. Behind them, the room was full of wool, but that wasn’t the point. The idea was to create a network of conversations. From this you can see that my mother wasn’t the craziest person in the institution. There must have been much crazier people.</p>
<p>And if someone thinks that wool balls are not crazy enough, then they’ve definitely heard nothing about paper boxes. Everyone in the clinic had a paper box in their rooms. It hanged under the ceiling, with the opening faced up, and you had to throw notes in like a basketball hoop. Notes, on which you’ve written wishes, stuff you want to say, intents and such. When my mom had wishes or intents, she basically wrote them on a piece of paper and went practically Dirk Nowitzki: dunking. And the bizarre thing was, nobody reads those stuff. That’s not the point of it. The point was, you write them out and then they’re there and you can see them: My wishes and problems and the whole thing is in this box up there. And because there box was so important, you also had to name it. It’s written on the box with a marker, and then almost everyone had a box with “god” written on it hanging in their rooms. Because, therapists recommended that. But you could call it however you want. An old lady called hers “Osiris” and someone else “Big Ideas”.</p>
<p>My mom’s box was “Karl-Heinz”, and then the therapist came to her. At first, he wanted to know whether that was her father. “Who?” My mom asked, and the therapist pointed to the box. My mom shaked her head. And then, the therapist asked who that should’ve been, this Karl-Heinz, and my mom said: “The box there.” And then the therapist wanted to know what was my mom’s father’s name. “Gottlieb”, my mom answered, and the therapist went “Aha!”.</p>
<p>And I wrote all of that in my essay. In order to bring up the word “rescue”, I added the thing with the kitchen knife, and because I was in the mood, I also included the part where she mistook me for my dad on the next day. That was the longest essay I’ve ever written, at least eight pages, and I could’ve written part two and part three and part four if I wanted to, but looking at how it came out, part one was more than enough.</p>
<p>The class was filled with excitement during reading. Schuermann asked for silence and said: “Ok. Ok. How long do you have left? Ah, that long? It’s already enough, I would say.” And then I didn’t need to read the rest. During recess, Schuermann made me stay so he could finish reading my essay, and I stood next to him especially proud, because that was such an amazing success and because Schuermann wanted to read it to the end personally. Maik Klingenberg, the writer. And then Schuermann flipped my work upside-down, looked at me and shook his head, and I thought that was an approving headshake, kinda like “how can a sixth-grader write such great essays?” But then, he said: “Why are you grinning so much like that? Do you still think it’s funny?” And then it became clear to me, that it wasn’t such a success. At least, not with Schuermann.</p>
<p>He stood up and went to the window and looked outside. “Maik”, he said, and then he turned to me again. “That’s your mother. Have you thought of that?”</p>
<p>Obviously I made a huge mistake. But I didn’t know which one. But it’s clear to Schuermann, that I’ve made a big mistake with this story. And it was also somehow clear that he thought it was the most embarrassing essay in the history of the world. But I didn’t know why that was, he didn’t tell me, and to be honest, I still don’t know to this day. He just kept repeating that it was my mother, and I said that it was clear to me that my mother was my mother, and then he suddenly got loud and said that this essay was the most disgusting and repulsive and shameless thing he had come across in fifteen years of teaching and so on, and that I should immediately tear out these ten pages from my notebook. I was completely devastated and of course immediately grabbed my notebook like a complete idiot to tear out the pages, but Schürmann held my hand and shouted: “You shouldn’t really tear it out. Don’t you understand anything? You should think. Think!” I thought for a minute, and to be honest, I didn’t get it. I still don’t get it to this day. I mean, I didn’t invent anything or anything.</p>

        <h3 id="5"><a href="#5" class="headerlink" title="5"></a>5</h3><p>I didn’t have nicknames before. I mean, in school. But other than that, still none. My name is Maik Klingenberg. Maik. Not Maiki, not Klinge or other random shit, always just Maik. Except in year 6, where I was called Psycho for a bit. It’s not really exciting when you’re being called Psycho. But it didn’t last long, and I became Maik again.</p>
<p>When you don’t have any nicknames, there are usually two reasons. Either you’re boring as hell and just doesn’t manage to get any, or you don’t have any friends. If I were to choose one from the two for myself, I would, to be honest, like to have no friends than to be boring as hell. Because, if you’re boring, you automatically have zero friends, or you only have friends that are more boring than you.</p>
<p>There is a third possibility. It can be because you are boring and you don’t have any friends. And I’m afraid that’s my problem. Ever since Paul moved away. Paul was my friend from kindergarten, and we meet up almost every day, until his mom decided she wanted to live in nature.</p>
<p>That was about the time I came to junior high, and it didn’t make my life easier. I rarely see Paul from then. I would have to travel half of the world with the tram and then do another six kilometers with a bicycle. Other then that, Paul changed out there. His parents had divorced and he went crazy. I mean, really crazy. Paul now lives in the woods with his mother and is lost in the swamp. He always had this tendency to become lost in the swamp. You always had to push him. But nobody pushed him out there anymore and he is completely lost in the swamp. I’ve visited him at most three times. And every time, he was so depressed, I never wanted to go back. Paul showed me the house and the garden and the forest and a perch in the forest, which he always sat on to observe wildlife. Only thing, there are obviously no animals whatsoever. A sparrow would come by every two hours. And he even has a book about that. It was early in the year, just when GTA IV came out, but Paul wasn’t interested in that anymore. Only this rubbish. I had to sit on the perch with him for a whole day, and then it’s too boring for me. I secretly flipped through his book one time, just to see what was in it, because, there are a lot of random shit in there. Stuff about his mom and coded stuff, and there were drawings of naked women, very horrible drawings. No, I don’t mean anything against naked women, naked women are great. But these drawings definitely weren’t, they are just horrifying, and there were a few pages about animal observation and the weather in between. Paul saw wild boars, leopards and wolves at the end, wolves with a question mark, and I said: “It’s literally the outskirts of Berlin – leopards and wolves, are you really sure?” And he just grabbed the book from me and looked at me, like I was the wrong one. And then we didn’t see each other that often. It’s been three years. That was at some point my best friend.</p>
<p>I didn’t know anyone at school first. I’m not really good at knowing new people. And that hasn’t been a big problem for me. Until Tatjana Cosic came. Or until I noticed her. Because Tatjana was always in my class. But I first noticed her in year 7. Why is that so, I do not know. But in year 7 I fell for her head to toe, and then the whole thing started. And now, I should somehow start describing Tatjana. Because if not, everything after this will make no sense.</p>
<p>Tatjana’s first name is Tatjana and her last name is Cosic. She is fourteen years old and has a height of 1.65 meters, and her parents also have the same last name Cosic. I don’t know their first names. She comes from Serbia or Croatien, you can tell it from the name, and her family rented a white house with many windows. As you can see: I can’t go on for too long, but the surprising thing is, I don’t know what I’m talking about. Because, I don’t know Tatjana. I know her like everyone in the same class as her would. I know how she looks like, what her name is and that she’s good at PE and English. And so on. That her height is 1.65, I knew that from the physical exam day. Where she lives, I knew that from the telephone book, and I practically know nothing else. And I can logically also describe her appearence and her voice and her hair and all that. But I know, that’s not it. Because, everyone can describe her appearence: She looks super. Her voice is also super. She is just super. Everyone can do that.</p>

        <h3 id="4"><a href="#4" class="headerlink" title="4"></a>4</h3><p>The doctor is a lot less talkative. “That’s just a piece of meat.”, he says, “Muscles,”, he says, “are not bad, that’s gonna grow. Maybe a few dents and scars.” He says, “that’s gonna look sexy.” and he says that every day. Every day, he looks at the dressing and says that a scar will stay, that it’s not bad, that it’s gonna look like I’ve been through war later on. “Just like you’ve been through war, young man, women are gonna respect that.”, he says, and it’s supposed to have a deeper meaning, but I don’t really understand that, and then he usually blinks at me, I would blink back, although I don’t understand a thing.</p>
<p>Finally, the man helped me, so I’m gonna help him.</p>
<p>Our conversations became a lot more pleasant later on, most importantly, because they’ve turned a lot more serious. But, it’s just a conversation. When I can limp again, he brings me into his room, in which there is a desk and no medical equipments, and then we sit face to face like firm bosses that are negotiating our next deal. A model of the upper human body made out of plastic, from which the organs can be taken out of, is on the desk. The upper arm kinda looks like a brain, and from the stomach, the colors kinda flake off.</p>
<p>“I must talk to you.”, the doctor says, and that is logically the dumbest start for a conversation that I know. And then I wait for him to start speaking first, but that’s unfortunately a part of this start, where you say I must talk to you, and then doesn’t speak at first. So the doctor stares at me, then lowers his gaze and opens a green cardboard folder. Or doesn’t open it, but opens it, like I imagine him cutting open a patient’s abdomen. Not the best sight, very complicated, and serious. </p>
<p>After that, it’s a lot less interesting. Down to the ground, he just wants to know where the wound on my head , on the front right corner, came from. Also where the other scars came from – from the roads, like I’ve said, okay, he already knew that–, but the one on the head, I fell from the chair when I was in the road police station.</p>
<p>The doctor holds his hands together. Yeah, that’s definitely not gonna come into consideration: fell from a chair. In the police station.</p>
<p>He nods. Yeah.</p>
<p>I nod too.</p>
<p>“We’re alone here,” he says after a while. “I know,” I say like an idiot and wink first at the doctor and then, just to be on the safe side, at the plastic torso.</p>
<p>“You can talk about everything here. I’m your doctor, and I’m sworn to secrecy.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, ok.” I said. He said something similar a couple of days ago, I get the meaning now. He’s sworn to secrecy, and he’s expecting me to tell him something and then he can keep my secret. But what? How cool it is to piss in your pants out of fear? </p>
<p>“It’s not just the way you acted. It’s a breach of duty of care. They shouldn’t have relied on your information, you understand? They should have looked into it and, above all, called the doctor immediately. Do you know how critical that was? And you say you fell off your chair?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but we doctors are suspicious people. I mean, they wanted a lot out of you. And I, as your doctor…”</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. God. Secrecy. It’s kinda clear. But what does he want to know? How I fell from the chair? He shook his head at first, then he moved his hand a tiny bit – and then it became clear to me, what he wanted. My God. Always this shit. Why doesn’t he just say it?</p>
<p>“No, No!” I shout and circle my hand in the air, as if I’m chasing a swarm of bugs away. “Everything’s true! I sat on a stool and my pants were folded up, and then I saw that and then the dizziness and stuff. No external influences.” Great word. Knew that from the scene of the cirme.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Sure. Yes. And the police were really nice. I even got some water and a tissue. Just because of dizziness and falling over.” I stand up from the desk and deliberately limp towards the right for two times.</p>
<p>“Ok.” the doctor said slowly.</p>
<p>He scribbled something on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to know. Still irresponsible. Blood…you really…doesn’t look like that.”</p>
<p>He shut the green folder and looked at me for a long time. “And I’m not sure, maybe it doesn’t work for me – but I’m interested now. You don’t have to answer if you don’t like it. But – what were you planning? Or where?”</p>
<p>“No idea.”</p>
<p>“Just like I’ve said, you don’t have to answer. I’m just asking out of interest.”</p>
<p>“I would tell you. But when I’ve told you, you’re not gonna believe it. At least I think so.”</p>
<p>“I believe everything you say.” He smiled, friendly.</p>
<p>“It’s wicked.”</p>
<p>“What’s wicked?”</p>
<p>“It’s…we wanted to go to Walachei. You see, you’re gonna find it strange.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so, I just don’t understand. Where?”</p>
<p>“Walachei.”</p>
<p>“Where should that be?” He looks at me full of interest, and I gather that I’m turning red. We didn’t deepen the conversation. Finally, we shaked hands like grown-ups, and I’m somehow pleased, that I didn’t have to trespass his secrecy.</p>

        <h3 id="3"><a href="#3" class="headerlink" title="3"></a>3</h3><p>You have to admit, you can say a lot about hospitals, but you can’t say it’s not nice in there. I always liked staying in hospitals. You do nothing for the whole day, and then the nurses come. They are all super young and super friendly. And they wear this short, white overall, which I find great, because you can just see what underwear they have on. Why I find that good, I don’t have a single idea. Because, if someone were running on the streets with this white overall on, I would say it’s just foolish. But when it’s in a hospital, it’s cool. Only my opinion. It’s kinda like in a mafia film, where one of the gangsters always keeps quiet for a minute before they answer. “Hey!” A minute of silence. “Look at me in the eyes!” Five minutes of silence. In real life, it’s just weird, but not in a mafia.</p>
<p>My favorite nurse is Hanna, she comes from Libanon. She has short dark hair and wears <em>normal</em> underwear. And that’s also great: normal underwear. Other ones often look a little bit sad. When you don’t have the figure of Megan Fox, it can look a little despairing. I don’t know, maybe I’m a pervert: I like <em>normal</em> underwear.</p>
<p>Hanna is actually only a nurse student, that means she’s an intern or something, and when she enters my room, she always knocks the door with two fingers at first, which I find very, very polite, and she makes up a new name for me every day. At first, I was Maik, then Maiki, then Maikipaiki, at some time, I already started thinking: old pie. But that wasn’t the end. Then I was called Michael Schumacher, then Attila the King of the Huns, then pigkiller and finally the sick rabbit. I would stay at this hospital for another year just for that.</p>
<p>Hanna changes my dressing daily. That hurts a lot, it also hurts Hanna, you can see it from her face.</p>
<p>“The main thing is for you to have fun.” she always says that when she’s finished, and then I would say that I’m gonna somehow marry her later or something like that. But unfortunately, she already has a boyfriend. Sometimes, she just comes and sits at my bed, because without those I get practically no visits, and it’s really a leisure activity that we do. A real adult activity. It’s always easier to talk with women like Hanna than girls my age. If someone can explain why, please call me, because I don’t get it.</p>

        <h3 id="2"><a href="#2" class="headerlink" title="2"></a>2</h3><p>The doctor is opening and closing his mouth like a carp. It took a few seconds for words to come out. The doctor was shouting. Why is he shouting? He’s kinda screaming at the small woman. And then, the uniforms got mixed up, a blue one. A police that I didn’t know. He rebuked the doctor. From what did I actually know that that’s a doctor? He’s wearing a white overall. Can also be a baker. But he has a metal lamp and a “listening thing” in his pocket. What should a baker do with this listening thing, listen to bread? Now that’s definitely a doctor. And now, the doctor’s pointing towards my head and roaring. I fumble with my legs under the sheets. They’re dry. Doesn’t feel all pissed and bloody. Where the hell am I?</p>
<p>I lay on my back. The ceiling is yellow. I turn to the side: big, dark windows. Other side: white plastic curtains. Hospital, I would say. That also fits the doctor. And yeah, the small woman is also wearing a overall with a writing block in her hand. And which hospital? Maybe the charity? Nah, not a single idea. I’m probably not in Berlin. Maybe I could ask, but no one’s paying attention on me. Because, the police doesn’t like it, when the doctor’s shouting at him, so he shouts louder back, but then the doctor gets even louder – and then, you’re starting to get interested in who’s right. Clearly the doctor and not the police, and I’m so exhausted and also somehow happy and tired, cushioned by happiness and slept again, without saying a single word. The happiness, I learned later, is called valium. They gave me quite a big dose.</p>
<p>When I woke up again, it turned bright. The sun is in the big widow. My footpads were being scratched. Aha, another doctor, a different one this time, and he also has a nurse. No police. Only that the scratching of my footpads is not so comfortable. Why is he doing that?</p>
<p>“He’s awake.” The nurse said. Not so emotional.</p>
<p>“Ah, aha.” The doctor looked at me. “How are you feeling?”</p>
<p>I wanted to say something. But the only thing that came out was: “Pfff.”</p>
<p>“How are you doing? Do you know what your name is?”</p>
<p>“Pfff-fah?”</p>
<p>What kind of a question is that? Do they think I’ve turned insane? I look at the doctor, and he returns the sight, and then he goes above me and puts a lamp in my face. Is this interrogation? Should I say my name or something? Is it the torture hospital here? And when can he stop trying to keep my eyes open, or at least do something to show that he’s interested in my answer? But I didn’t say anything. Because, when I was still thinking about if I should say Maik Klingenberg or just Maik or Klinge or Attila the King of the Huns – my father always says that, when he’s only had bad news for the whole day, then, he drinks a bunch a beer and addresses himself on telephone as Attila the King of the Huns – I mean, as I’m still thinking if I should say something in this situation, the doctor said something like “four here” and “three there”, and I fell asleep again.</p>

        <h3 id="1"><a href="#1" class="headerlink" title="1"></a>1</h3><p>First, there was the smell of blood and coffee. The coffee machine is there on the desk, and the blood is in my shoe. To be honest, it’s not only blood. When the elderly said “fourteen”, I peed my pants. I sat diagonally on the stool without moving the whole time. I was dizzy. I tried to think about how Tschick would be like when a “fourteen” hit him in the face, and then I peed my pants out of fear. Maik Klingenberg, the hero. I don’t really know where the hype came from. It was clear that the whole thing came to an end. Tschick definitely wouldn’t piss himself.</p>
<p>Where is Tschick? I didn’t see him on the road, like him with one leg bouncing into a bush, but once I think about it, he has to fight against it. You can’t go far with only one leg. I definitely couldn’t ask the police. Because, if they didn’t see him, it is logically better to not even mention the thing. Maybe they didn’t see him after all. And they’re not gonna get a word out of me. Then they can torture me. Although the German police, I believe, aren’t allowed to torture people. That can only happen on TV or in Turkey.</p>
<p>But sitting in the police station all dirty and blood-covered while answering question from others just isn’t it. Maybe torturing would be a bit better, then I would at least have an explanation for all this excitement.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is keep your mouth shut, Tschick said taht. And I see the same. Now, where everything is pointless. And I don’t care about a single thing. Well, almost. Tatjana Cosic, for example, isn’t “a single thing”. Even though I haven’t thought of her for a really long time. But when I sit on this very stool and look at the road outside and with the older police standing by the coffee machine back there for five minutes, filling water and dumping it out, reaching under the counter and trying to see what’s wrong when every literal dumbass can clearly tell that the plug of the extension cable isn’t plugged, I have to think about Tatjana again. Because, if it weren’t for her, I wouldn’t be here. Although she has nothing to do with the whole thing. Am I speaking a bit unclear? Sorry for that. I’m gonna try later. Tatjana doesn’t come up in the whole story. The most beautiful girl in the whole world has no role in this. On the whole trip, I always imagined that she could see us. How we stomped through the corn field. How we stood on the rubbish pile with a bunch of hoses in our hands like the last two fools in the world… I always imagined that Tatjana was behind us, and she was seeing everything we saw, and she felt excited just like we did. But now, I’m only glad that was something I made up.</p>
<p>The police took a piece of green tissue from the tissue box and gave it to me. What should I do with it? Mop the floor? He squeezes his nose with two fingers and look at me. Oh, nose sneezing. I sneezed my nose, and he smiled. That, I could tell apart from torture. I look around the floor. The whole station was laid out with green linoleum, just like the entrance hall in our school. It smells a bit like that. Piss, sweat and linoleum. I can see our PE teacher, Wolkow, in a training suit, springing across the hall, seventy years old, and training: Let’s go, boys! Hop, Hop! The noise from his smacking steps on the ground, and the giggling straight out of the girl’s toilet. I can see the high windows, the benches, the rings on the ceiling. I can see Natalie and Lena and Kimberley enter the hall from the side entrance. And Tatjana in her green training suit. I see her reflection on the hall floor, The glittering pants that girls always wear, and the upper piece. And that half of them do gymnastics with wool pullovers on and at least three have a medical certificate. Hagecius-Middle-School Berlin, eighth class.</p>
<p>“I thought, fifteen?” I said, and the police shaked his head.</p>
<p>“No, fourteen. Fourteen. What’s up with the coffee, Horst?”</p>
<p>“The machine’s broken.” Horst said.</p>
<p>I want to speak to my lawyer.</p>
<p>That was the sentence, that I had to somehow say. That’s the right sentence in the right situation, just like how everyone knew from the TV. But it’s so easy: I want to speak to my lawyer. They’re gonna laugh their heads out. The problem is: I don’t know what this sentence menas. When I say, I want to speak to my lawyer, and they ask: “To whom you want to speak? <em>Your lawyer?</em>“ What should I answer then? I haven’t seen a single lawyer in my life, and I also don’t know, why would I be needing one. I don’t know what’s the difference between an attorney, a lawyer and a prosecutor. I’ll just take that it’s something similar to a judge, but he stands on my side and knows more about laws than me. But practically everybody in the room knows more about laws than me. And I could naturally ask them. But I know, if I ask the younger one, whether I need such a lawyer right now, he’ll just call out to his colleagues: “Hey, Horst! Horshi! Come over here! Our hero wants to know whether he needs a lawyer or not! Look at him. Blood shed all over the floor, pissed himself just like a world champion and – want’s to speak to <em>his lawyer</em>!” Hahaha. Then they’re gonna laugh until they’re broken. And I find my experience already horrible enough, I really don’t need myself insulted. What happened, happened. And nothing more. The lawyer can’t do anyting about that either. Because only a psycho could try to deny that we’ve been crap. What should I say? That I stayed at home, in our pool the whole week, you can ask the janitor? That pork sides fell from the sky like crazy? I really can’t do much know. I can still pray to Mecca and shit myself in the pants, other than that, options really are limited.</p>
<p>The younger, who actually seemed nice at first, shook his head again and repeated: “Fifteen is nonsense. Fourteen. You’re responsible for crime from fourteen.”</p>
<p>Somehow, I should feel guilty and remorseful and stuff like that, but, to be honest, I don’t feel anything. I’m just crazily dizzy. I’m scratching myself by my calf. Only there, where my calf was, isn’t anymore. A red stripe is across my hand. That’s not <em>my</em> blood, I said earlier, when they asked me. There are random shit laying on the street ready for people to mess around with, and I really thought that wasn’t my blood. But if it isn’t my blood, where is my calf?</p>
<p>I roll up my pants and look at what’s under me. I had just a second to stare at the scene. If I saw that in a movie, I’m gonna feel horrible, and in fact, I am kinda nasty right now, in this surprisingly quiet road police station. I saw my reflection on the linoleum, and then it banged, and I’m going.</p>

        <h3 id="Wednesday"><a href="#Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>Today, it snowed for the first time this year and school was closed. We originally had a math test, but with the whole school guide thing, I’ve been slacking off a bit. So I was extremely happy.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-05_142919.png"></p>
<p>I called Rupert and told him to come. We’ve been wanting to build the biggest snowman in the world for a couple few years.</p>
<p>And when I say the biggest snowman in the world, I mean the it. We want it to be in the Guinness records.</p>
<p>But every time we wanted to start the project, the snow starts melting, and winter is officially gone. This year is the perfect chance.</p>
<p>We began as soon as Rupert arrived by rolling out some balls. In my plan, the balls should be at least three meters high, if we actually want to break the world record. But they are turn heavier as we keep rolling. And we have to take a break now and then.</p>
<p>When we were pausing, mom came outside and wanted drive to the supermarket, but our snowball was in the way. So she did us a favor.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-05_143812.png"></p>
<p><em>Ach! It’s heavy!</em></p>
<p>After the break we went on with the rolling, until we were unable to make the balls any bigger. Then we carefully observed our piece of work for the first time, and saw, what a catastrophe we’ve created.</p>
<p>The snowball was so heavy, dad’s garden, which he planted last autumn, stuck onto it.</p>
<p>I hoped for a few more centimeters of snow to cover up the scene of the crime, but the snow suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Our plan the build the largest snowman in the world is starting to fall apart. But I thought of a better plan for the snowballs.</p>
<p>When it snows, the kids always comes onto Whirley Street to snowboard.</p>
<p>That means, tomorrow, when the kids come out again, I and Rupert will teach them a lesson.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-13_203207.png"></p>
<h3 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>When I waked up today, the snow had already started to melt. So I called Rupert and said that he should come straight to me.</p>
<p>When I was waiting for Rupert, I watched Manni trying to build a snowman out of the few bits of pieces we left when we were rolling our giant snowball.</p>
<p>It was really a tragic play.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-13_203541.png"></p>
<p>I can’t think of anything more unlucky than dad looking out of the window right that moment.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-13_203636.png"></p>
<p>Dad was ALREADY a bit angry at me, because I ruined his lawn, so I knew right then: angry he is! I heard the garage door go up. Dad came, armed with a snow shovel, and I was thinking, I should find a better place for my grave than this.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-13_204227.png"></p>
<p>But dad didn’t come towards me, but toward my snowball. And in less than a minute, my work turned to nothing.</p>
<p>In a few minutes, Rupert came. I thought, maybe he would think it’s funny.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-13_204349.png"></p>
<p>But he was really excited about rolling the thing down the street, because he suddenly turned sour. And the unbelievable happened: Rupert was angry to ME, because of something MY DAD did.</p>
<p>If my teacher, Mrs. Levine was there, she would probably say that the whole thing had an “ironic” touch.</p>
<h3 id="Thursday-1"><a href="#Thursday-1" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>I and Rupert decided to create our own comic. After school he went to mine and we started with the work.</p>
<p>We created the characters with ease. But when it went on to the part when we had to make up jokes, we could’t go on.</p>
<p>Suddenly I had an idea.</p>
<p>I found a comic with the character saying “oh mama” every single time.</p>
<p>So we didn’t have to think about the lines anymore, and could concentrate on the pictures.</p>
<p>I did the writing and drawing for the first few comics and Rupert colored them in.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-18_145124.png"></p>
<p><em>If you step on a crack, it’ll bring you back luck!</em></p>
<p><em>Ok, whatever.</em></p>
<p><em>Hey Timmy, your mom tripped on a banana peel and p.s. She’s dead.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh mama!</em></p>
<p>To be honest, the quality of the comics quickly went down when Rupert did the writing.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-18_145717.png"></p>
<p><em>I’ve been waiting for a hamburger for three hours.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally! A hamburger, please!</em></p>
<p><em>Sorry, burgers are out.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh mama!</em></p>

        <h3 id="Wednesday"><a href="#Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>Now I know what I can do with the Big Wheel that Rupert gave me for Christmas. I created a game where someone drives around and the other tries to hit them with a football.</p>
<p>First was Rupert the Driver and I the thrower.</p>
<p>It’s a lot harder than I thought to meet the goal. Other than that, I didn’t have much time to practice. After every start, it took Rupert about ten minutes to get back on track.</p>
<p>Rupert wanted to switch constantly and let me also try the car. But I’m not interested. The thing went down hill in about fifty parts and there were no brakes!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-07_210858.png"></p>
<p><em>You don’t wanna try it?</em></p>
<p><em>No thanks…You can do it a lot better!</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I didn’t succeed in getting Rupert off the Big Wheel for a single time today. But at least I had something to do for the rest of the Christmas break.</p>
<h3 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>I wanted to go to Rupert’s today to play the Big-Wheel-game again, but mom said that I had to write my Christmas gratitude letters first before I could go anywhere.</p>
<p>I thought that I’m gonna finish it easily in half an hour, but when it came to the actual writing, there was nothing in my brain.</p>
<p>It’s really not easy to show gratitude for things you don’t want at all.</p>
<p>I started with the people that didn’t give me a sweater, because I thought those would be easier. But after two or three letters I gave up and decided that I’m gonna write more or less every time.</p>
<p>So I found a pre-made letter form online and left spaces for the necessary changes. And then it became a lot easier.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-07_212203.png"></p>
<p><em>Dear Aunt Lydia,</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you so much for the great lexicon!</em></p>
<p><em>How did you know I wanted that for Christmas?</em></p>
<p><em>The lexicon looks great on my bookshelf!</em></p>
<p><em>My friends would definitely envy me, when I have my own lexicon.</em></p>
<p><em>I hope you have the best Christmas ever!</em></p>
<p><em>Your Greg</em></p>
<p>It worked great for the first few gifts, but as I went on, it got off track a bit.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-18_210403.png"></p>
<p><em>Dear Aunt Loretta,</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you so much for the great pants!</em></p>
<p><em>How did you know I wanted that for Christmas?</em></p>
<p><em>The pants looks great in my legs!</em></p>
<p><em>My friends would definitely envy me, when I have my own pants.</em></p>
<p><em>I hope you have the best Christmas ever!</em></p>
<p><em>Your Greg</em></p>
<h3 id="Friday"><a href="#Friday" class="headerlink" title="Friday"></a>Friday</h3><p>Today, I finally managed to hit Robert on the Big Wheel, but from then it didn’t go as I thought. I wanted to hit him in the shoulder, but I wasn’t accurate enough and the football ended up landing under the tricycle.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-18_210914.png"></p>
<h3 id="Monday"><a href="#Monday" class="headerlink" title="Monday"></a>Monday</h3><p>The Christmas holidays are gone and school officially starts today. Are you still worrying about Rupert and the tricycle accident? He broke his hand. And now he’s wearing a cast. And today everyone was around him, like he’s a hero or something.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-20_153539.png"></p>
<p><em>Does it still hurt?</em></p>
<p><em>Well, a bit.</em></p>
<p><em>You poor little thing!</em></p>
<p>I tried to steal Rupert’s show, but it worked the opposite way.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-20_153824.png"></p>
<p><em>I’m the one that broke his arm!</em></p>
<p><em>You devil!</em></p>
<p>At lunch, a couple of girls invited Rupert to their desks, to FEED him.</p>
<p>What annoyed me the most, was that Rupert is a right-hander and broke his LEFT hand! He can feed himself no problem.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-20_155135.png"></p>
<p><em>Here comes the plane!</em></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday"><a href="#Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Rupert’s arm inspired me. I thought, I needed one of those myself.</p>
<p>I found some rubbish bags at home and wrapped my hand with them.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize that the girls wouldn’t treat me like Rupert, but then I understood the situation.</p>
<p>If you have an actual cast, everyone would want to write their name on it. But a marker doesn’t work too good on a plastic bag.</p>
<p>So I found another solution to the problem, and, to be honest, it worked great!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-25_133729.png"></p>
<p><em>Do you want to be the first to sign?</em></p>
<p>But that went down the drain. My arm attracted some people and they wanted to examine it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-25_133921.png"></p>
<p><em>Can I see your arm?</em></p>
<p><em>Stop right there.</em></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday-1"><a href="#Tuesday-1" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Last weak the new semester started, so now we have some new subjects. One of which was “unconstant group work”.</p>
<p>I WANTED to join group 2, because I was already doing great in group 1.</p>
<p>But as a boy, being able to sew doesn’t get you a whole lot of popularity.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-25_134217.png"></p>
<p><em>Look! Gref has a purse!</em></p>
<p><em>That’s a self-made book bag.</em></p>
<p><em>Fine, still a purse.</em></p>
<p>This subject was an experiment, and they’re trying it out in our school for the first time.</p>
<p>The idea is that every class gets a project and we work on it in groups without teachers for the whole semester.</p>
<p>The flaw in the plan is that everyone in the group gets the same grade at the end. When I was told that Ricky Fischer was in my group, I knew it was trouble.</p>
<p>Ricky is mainly known for the things he do, such as collecting old gum stuck under his desk and eating them mindlesly. So I definitely am not expecting anything high for our group.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-25_134641.png"></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday-2"><a href="#Tuesday-2" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Today, we got the task for our group project, and guess what it is? We’re supposed to build a robot! At first, everyone was overwhelmed, because we thought, we had to make an actual robot all by ourselves.</p>
<p>But Mr. Darnell explained to us that we don’t have build real ones. We only have to design the appearance and the functions.</p>
<p>Then he went out of the classroom and we were on our own. We started by collecting some ideas. I wrote the suggestions on the board.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-29_210712.png"></p>
<p><em>The robot should: do homework do the dishes make breakfast brush teeth</em></p>
<p>The others were impressed by my ideas, but it wasn’t hard at all. I just wrote all the stuff I didn’t like to do.</p>
<p>Then a few girls went up and wrote their own ideas. They wiped mine and wrote theirs instead.</p>
<p>They wanted a robot that can give out fashion tips and has ten different shades of lip gloss for the ten fingers.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-29_210934.png"></p>
<p>We boys thought that was the worst idea of all times. So we divided ourselves into two groups: boys and girls. The boys went to the other side of the classroom, when the girls stood still and chatted.</p>
<p>Now that we had the people who seriously wanted to work, we started. Someone suggested that the robot should be able to repeat any name told to it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-29_211341.png"></p>
<p><em>Hello, BOB. It’s nice to meet you, BOB.</em></p>
<p>But then someone said, you shouldn’t use swear words as names, because the robot isn’t allowed to swear. So we decided to make a list of the swear words that the robot shouldn’t be able to use.</p>
<p>We wrote out all the normal ones, but then Ricky Fischer somehow knew twenty more which none of us have ever heard before.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-29_211623.png"></p>
<p>So, Ricky was the most worthy participant of the project in the end.</p>
<p>Before long, Mr. Darnell came back to see how we were going. He found our list and looked through.</p>
<p>To make things short, there won’t be any “unconstant group work” for this semester.</p>
<p>At least not for us boys. If all the robots have lip-glosses as fingers in the future, you’ll know how it came to that.</p>
<h3 id="Thursday-1"><a href="#Thursday-1" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>Today, there was a school meeting to watch the movie “I think I’m great!”. We watch it every single year.</p>
<p>The movie basically tells you that you should be satisfied with who you are and you shouldn’t try to deliberately change yourself.</p>
<p>To be honest, I think it’s totally wrong for kids, especially for my school.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_152808.png"></p>
<p>Then they said that they were looking for student guides. That got me an idea.</p>
<p>If someone gets into a fight with a student guide, they could end up being expelled. The way I see it, a little extra security doesn’t do any harm.</p>
<p>Other than that, I think a bit of authority could do me good.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_153258.png"></p>
<p><em>Could we please cross the street now?</em></p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p><em>But we’ve been standing here for an hour!</em></p>
<p>So I went to Mr. Winter’s office and applied for the job, and I also talked Rupert into it. I thought, we had to do high knees or push-ups or something to get the job, but he just gave us the badges and the ribbons.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_153544.png"></p>
<p>Then he said, there was a special order for us. Next to our school, there’s a primary school and for some reason there’s a bunch of kindergarten kids in there.</p>
<p>Mr. Winter wants us to escort the kids home at noon. I caught the meaning immediately: we could skip twenty minutes of math! Rupert wanted to say something, but I stomped his feet under the desk like crazy before he could finish his sentence.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_153905.png"></p>
<p><em>But then we’re gonna miss OOOUUUCH!</em></p>
<p>I couldn’t believe my luck. I got extra protection and an excuse to skip a half of my math session, without having to do anything!</p>
<h3 id="Tuesday-3"><a href="#Tuesday-3" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Today was our first day as student guides. I and Rupert didn’t have specific positions like the others, so we didn’t have to stand in the cold for a whole hour.</p>
<p>But we still picked up some hot kakao, which were distributed to all the student guides before the first session.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_154549.png"></p>
<p>What’s more: we could go to the first period ten minutes later.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_155015.png"></p>
<p>This school guide thing is really sick!</p>
<p>At 12:15, I left class with Rupert to guide the kindergarten kids to home. The whole thing took three quarters, and when we returned, there’s only 20 minutes math left.</p>
<p>Guiding the kids back home was no problem. But one of them started to sniff all weird midway, and I knew right away that something happened.</p>
<p>He wanted to say something, but I just didn’t pay attention to him and went on. I only bring them home, but I’m not responsible for anything else! No way!</p>

        <h3 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>It’s only a few days till the performance, and I still have no idea how we can make this work.</p>
<p>First, nobody took the actual efforts to learn their roles. And Mrs. Norton is sour about it.</p>
<p>During rehearsal, she’s always hinting the lines.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_144943.png"></p>
<p>Well, I don’t know how it’s gonna work next Tuesday, if Mrs. Norton has to stay ten meters away from the piano.</p>
<p>Other than that, it’s spreading between us that Mrs. Norton is still creating new scenes and figures.</p>
<p>Yesterday, she decided that a first grader will play Dorothy’s dog: Toto. But today, the boy’s mother came and wanted her son upright, because it’s “shameful” to be on all fours.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_145559.png"></p>
<p>Now, we have a dog that’s running on it’s back legs all the time.</p>
<p>But the worst change is that Mrs. Norton composed a song for the TREES. She said that everyone who joined should be “allowed” to sing a song.</p>
<p>So today, we sang the most horrible song of all times for a whole hour.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_145949.png"></p>
<p><em>We are three trees…</em></p>
<p>Thank god Rodrick wasn’t coming to see this absolute catastrophe. Mrs. Norton said, the performance was going to take place in our hall, and I knew, Rodrick would never give up time for a school performance.</p>
<p>But there are good news today. Towards the end of rehearsal, Andy Kelly stomped over Philip James and lost a corner of a tooth, because he couldn’t support his body with his arms.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_150350.png"></p>
<p>The good news is, we’re finally getting armholes in our costumes.</p>
<h3 id="Tuesday"><a href="#Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Today was the great performance of “The Wizard of Oz”! Before it started, there were already a few signs showing that this wasn’t gonna go smooth.</p>
<p>I peeked through the curtains to see how many people were coming and who was there in the first row? My brother Rodrick, even with a tie!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_150921.png"></p>
<p>It was clear then, that I had to sing, and I had to sing with shame. The performance should’ve started at 8, but there was a delay because Philip James suddenly got stage fright.</p>
<p>At first, you would think that when one only needs to quietly sit on the ground and do absolutely nothing, he could hold it for an introduction’s time. But Philip was sweating a whole lot and had to be carried to his parents finally.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_151351.png"></p>
<p>The introduction finally began at half past eight. Just as I said, no one was able to recite their lines, and Mrs. Norton had to run back and forth between the backstage and her piano. The little boy who played Toto needed a stool and a bunch of comic books on the stage, so the part with the dog was totally ruined.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_151836.png"></p>
<p>When the forest scene came, I went into position with the other trees. The curtains went up and right this moment I heard Manni yell.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_152050.png"></p>
<p>Oh, great. I successfully hid this nickname for five years, and now the whole city knows it. I got about 300 eyes on me.</p>
<p>So I improvised a bit and got it on Andy Kelly.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_152234.png"></p>
<p><em>You lost an apple, “Bubi”.</em></p>
<p>But the biggest embarrassment was yet to came. When Mrs. Norton played the first note of “We are Three Trees”, my heartbeat suddenly got to my nose.</p>
<p>I looked into the hall and there sat Rodrick with a video camera.</p>
<p>I knew, if Rodrick filmed me when I’m singing, he’s gonna show it to everyone and destroy my life.</p>
<p>I didn’t have a single idea what I should do. And when the first line came, I simply shut my mouth close.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_114850.png"></p>
<p><em>We are three trees…</em></p>
<p>Everything went by in the blink of an eye. I thought, if I didn’t actually sing, Rodrick would have nothing against me in his hand. But soon, the other trees noticed I wasn’t singing.</p>
<p>Maybe they thought I was somehow foxier than then, so they also quieted down.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_115100.png"></p>
<p>We three just stood there and didn’t say a single word. Mrs. Norton thought we forgot the lyrics, because she came under the stage from the piano and sang the rest.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_115158.png"></p>
<p>The song only lasted three minutes, but it felt more like thirty. I only wanted the curtains to fall down again and we can quietly stand on stage.</p>
<p>But then I saw Patty Farrell about to go up behind the curtains. If you ignore the blinks, we were three dead trees. And she thought we’ve ruined her hollywood career or something.</p>
<p>But when I saw her standing there, I suddenly realized why I wanted to be a tree in the first place.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_115443.png"></p>
<p>Soon, the other trees were also throwing apples at her. I think even Toto joined us.</p>
<p>Someone knocked Patty’s glasses off her nose and one of the lenses broke. After that, Mrs. Norton had to abruptly end the performance, because Patty couldn’t see a thing without her glasses.</p>
<p>When it ended, I went straight home with my family. But she threw it away when we were exiting.</p>
<p>I hope that others in the hall would find the performance just as funny as I have.</p>
<h3 id="Wednesday"><a href="#Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>The performance definitely did one thing for good: I don’t have to worry about the nickname “Bubi” anymore.</p>
<p>After the fifth session, I saw how they pushed Andy Kelly to the ground. That means, I can finally throw all this behind me.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_120009.png"></p>
<p><em>How’s it going, “Bubi”?</em></p>
<h3 id="Sunday"><a href="#Sunday" class="headerlink" title="Sunday"></a>Sunday</h3><p>After all that in school, I didn’t really have any time to think about the upcoming Christmas. And it’s only ten days away.</p>
<p>I only realized that Christmas is just outside the door when Rodrick sticked his wish list on the fridge.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_120146.png"></p>
<p><em>Rodrick’s wish list</em></p>
<p><em>1. new drums</em></p>
<p><em>2. new minibus</em></p>
<p><em>3. shrunken head</em></p>
<p>Usually I make a really long wish list for Christmas, but this year, I only wanted a video game called “Twisted Wizard”.</p>
<p>Today, Manni went through the Christmas catalog and marked everything he wanted with a thick red marker. Manni circled every single toy there is in there. He even marked a really expensive thing, I think it was an electric car or something like that.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_120359.png"></p>
<p>So I decided to write some advice to him, as an older brother.</p>
<p>I told him that if he circled things that are too expensive, he’s only gonna end up getting sweaters for Christmas. I said, he should choose three or four things that were average-priced, so he could at least get something he actually wanted in the end.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_120913.png"></p>
<p>But of course, Manni insisted on marking basically everything. Well then, he’ll have to learn from experiencing.</p>
<p>When I was seven, I only wished for a Barbie Dream House. And it’s totally NOT because I like girl’s toys as Rodrick claimed.</p>
<p>I only found it suitable for all my toy soldiers.</p>
<p>When Mom and Dad saw my wish list, they had a huge fight over it. Dad said he’s never going to buy me a puppet house, but mom found it good for me to “try out” new types of toys.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_121238.png"></p>
<p>Believe it or not: it was an actual fight that dad won! Dad said to me that I should make a new list with toys “appropriate” for boys.</p>
<p>But I have my secret weapon for Christmas. My uncle Charlie always buys me stuff I want. So I said to him that I wanted a Barbie Dream House, and he said of course he’s gonna buy it.</p>
<p>But when Charlie surprised me with his present at Christmas, it was NOT what I was hoping for. I think he went to a toy shop and simply bought the first thing he saw under the category “Barbie”.</p>
<p>When you see this picture of me holding a beach Barbie in the hand, you’ll know why.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_121645.png"></p>
<p>Dad wasn’t happy when he saw what uncle Charlie gave me. He said, I should either throw it away or sell it.</p>
<p>But I held on to the Barbie. And I’ll admit it, maybe I played with it for once or twice.</p>
<p>So two weeks later, I went to the clinic with a pink Barbie shoe shoved in the nose. And believe me, Rodrick would never forget that moment.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_122224.png"></p>
<h3 id="Thursday-1"><a href="#Thursday-1" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>Today I went with mom to the church to sort out a present for the christmas tree. The thing with the christmas tree is like a dream come true, where people gift the poor something special.</p>
<p>Mom found a red pullover for our “christmas-tree-guy”.</p>
<p>I wanted to persuade mom into buying something cooler, a TV or a ice cream machine or something.</p>
<p>I mean, your only Christmas present is a wool pullover.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-04_145121.png"></p>
<p>I’m pretty sure the guy’s gonna throw it straight into the trash.</p>
<h3 id="Christmas"><a href="#Christmas" class="headerlink" title="Christmas"></a>Christmas</h3><p>This year, about one million gifts were under the tree. But as I went through them, I realised that there were almost none with my name on it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-04_145241.png"></p>
<p>But Manni totally got on the gravy train. He got EVERYTHING that he marked on the catalog! Not joking. He’s definitely happy that he didn’t listen to me back then.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-04_145357.png"></p>
<p>I found a few things with my name on it, but they were mainly books and socks and so.</p>
<p>I packed my gifts in the corner behind the sofa, because I didn’t want to open them near my dad. Because when someone unpacks a gift, dad always gets up immediately and cleans the paper.</p>
<p>I gave Manni a helicopter and Rodrick a book about rock bands. Rodrick also gifted me a book, but his is obviously not wrapped. The book was “The Best of Little Putzi”. “Little Putzi” is a totally crooked newspaper comic, and Rodrick knows, how much I hate it. I think it’s the fourth Christmas he’s gave me something about it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_133808.png"></p>
<p>Then I surprised mom and dad with their gifts.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_133915.png"></p>
<p>The other relatives began arriving. And then uncle Charlie came.</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie had a big rubbish bag full of gifts and mine was the first one that he grabbed out.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_134510.png"></p>
<p>The package was just the right size for the “Twisted Wizard” video game. I knew then, that uncle Charlie wasn’t gonna leave me in pain. Mom turned on the camera and I ripped open the present.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_134620.png"></p>
<p>But it was only a 20 × 30 cm picture of uncle Charlie.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_134658.png"></p>
<p>I didn’t control my reaction there, so mom was kinda sour. I can only say that I’m happy to be a kid, because when I look at the gifts the adults get, I don’t know if I could pretend to be happy.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_135046.png"></p>
<p><em>cosy home</em></p>
<p><em>I know EXACTLY where to hang this!</em></p>
<p><em>I KNEW you would like it!</em></p>
<p>So I went up into my room to get a little alone time. A few minutes later, my dad was knocking at the door. He said that there was still a present for me in the garage, and that was because it was too big for wrapping.</p>
<p>And when I went with him into the garage, a brand new barbell set was standing there.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_135248.png"></p>
<p>That thing must’ve costed a fortune! I really didn’t want to tell my dad that I don’t have such passion with bodybuilding anymore, since we were finished with wrestling last week. So I simply said: “Thanks.”</p>
<p>Dad was, I’m pretty sure, expecting me to lay on the thing right away and start lifting, but I apologised quickly and went up again.</p>
<p>Three hours later, the relatives were gone.</p>
<p>I sat on the couch, with Manni by my side, playing with his new stuff, and felt rotten. Then, mom came and said she found a gift with my name on it behind the piano: “From Santa”</p>
<p>The packaging was too big for the video game, but mom already used the trick with the too-big package last year when she bought me a memory card for my game console.</p>
<p>So I ripped open the package and took out my present. But this time it wasn’t “Twisted Wizard” either. It was an ugly red pullover.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_135831.png"></p>
<p>At first I thought that mom wanted to prank me, because we gave our “Christmas-tree-guy” the exact same thing.</p>
<p>But mom seemed to be confused also. She said, she ACTUALLY bought the game for me, and has no idea why I got a sweater.</p>
<p>Then I realized. I told mom that there had had to be a mix-up somewhere. I got the gift for the “Christmas-tree-guy” and he got mine.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_140125.png"></p>
<p>Mom said, she used the same wrapping paper for both packages and maybe put the wrong name on them.</p>
<p>But then mom said that it’s still great because the guy would definitely be happy about the gift.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_140233.png"></p>
<p><em>It’s a Christmas wonder!</em></p>
<p>I had to explain to her that you needed a game console and a TV to play “Twisted Wizard”, which meant he couldn’t play it even if he got it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_140323.png"></p>
<p>Even though my Christmas didn’t go great, it’s definitely more horrible for the guy.</p>
<p>Then I kinda lost interest in this year’s Christmas and decided to go to Rupert’s.</p>
<p>I forgot to buy Rupert a present, so i just put a bow on the “Little Putzi” book that Rodrick gave me.</p>
<p>it worked perfectly.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_140824.png"></p>
<p>Rupert’s parents had a lot of money, so they always gave out great presents.</p>
<p>But Rupert said, he found a gift by himself for me this year. So he went out with me to show me.</p>
<p>For some reason, I thought he was gonna buy me a TV or a motorcycle or something.</p>
<p>Just like every other time, my hopes were way too high.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_141206.png"></p>
<p>Rupert buy me a tricycle. It was a really cool gift, but now, I have absolutely no idea of what I should do with it.</p>
<p>But Rupert was so excited, so I tried to pretend.</p>
<p>We went in again, so Rupert could show me what gifts he got.</p>
<p>He definitely got more than me. He even got the “Twisted Wizard” video game, so I could at least come here and play. At least before his dad notices how brutal the game is.</p>
<p>And I’m telling you, I haven’t seen anyone get so lucky as Rupert with his “Little Putzi” book. His mom said, it was the only thing he didn’t get on his wish list.</p>
<p>At least SOMEONE got one thing they wanted.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_142004.png"></p>
<p><em>It’s a Christmas wonder!</em></p>
<h3 id="Silvester"><a href="#Silvester" class="headerlink" title="Silvester"></a>Silvester</h3><p>Just in case you’re wondering, why I’m sitting in my room at 9 o’clock on Silvester, I’ll explain it now.</p>
<p>Earlier I and Manni were in the basement. I found a small black object on the carpet and he said it’s a spinner.</p>
<p>Then I grabbed the spinner over his head and acted as if I was gonna force him to eat it.</p>
<p>When I wanted to let Manni away, he pushed my arm and I let the thing fall. And can you guess what happened next? He swallowed it!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-07_204239.png"></p>
<p>Yeah, then he totally freaked out. He ran up to find mom, and I knew it, now I’m definitely dead.</p>
<p>Manni told mom I threatened him to eat the spinner. I told her it wasn’t a spinner and just lint.</p>
<p>Mom let Manni to the kitchen table. There she put out a seed, a raisin and a grape on a plate and said, that Manni should show her how big the lint was.</p>
<p>Manni stared at the plate for a bit.</p>
<p>Then he went to the fridge and took out an orange.</p>
<p>yeah, then she sent me back to my room at 19 o’clock, instead of letting me watch the Silvester shows downstairs.</p>
<p>And my only wish for next year, is to not play with Manni.</p>

        <h3 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>Today, we went by grandma’s house with the school bus. Someone covered it with toilet paper last night, I wasn’t really surprised about it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_203315.png"></p>
<p>Somehow I felt sorry, because it’s definitely gonna take a long time to clean it up. On the other hand, grandma definitely hasn’t experienced anything like this as a retiree.</p>
<h3 id="Wednesday"><a href="#Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>In the third hour, our PE teacher Mr. Underwood announced that the boys are going to learn wrestling for the next six weeks.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing boys at my school are good at, it’s wrestling. Mr. Underwood kinda threw a bomb into the crowd there.</p>
<p>After PE we had recess and the cafeteria was a pure madhouse.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_203645.png"></p>
<p>No idea how the school thought when they decided to teach wrestling.</p>
<p>I’ve decided that if I don’t want to get slammed in the next one-and-a-half month, I should finish my homework better, especially anything regarding wrestling.</p>
<p>So I lent two wrestling video games and wanted to learn a few tricks. After a few moments, I think I’ve got it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_204215.png"></p>
<p><em>Does that feel rightt?</em></p>
<p><em>YES! NO! HELP!</em></p>
<p>The other boys in my class should be more careful, because if this goes on, I can be really dangerous.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_204643.png"></p>
<p>On the other hand, I don’t want to be TOO good. A boy called Andy Loch was sporter of the month for once, because he played best in the basketball tournament, and they hung up his picture in the corridors.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_204817.png"></p>
<p>It took them about five seconds to check how “A. Loch” sounds when someone says it loud, and that was it for Andy.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_204915.png"></p>
<h3 id="Thursday-1"><a href="#Thursday-1" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>Today I realized that the type of wrestling Mr. Underwood talked about is TOTALLY different from the one in the TV.</p>
<p>First, you had to put on a thing called “jumpsuit”, which looked incredibly similar to the typical 1800s swimwear.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_205138.png"></p>
<p>There weren’t any rings with lines on the edge. Essentially, it was just a sweaty mat that looked ancient, as if it had been used for a long time.</p>
<p>The hour began with Mr. Underwood trying to find a volunteer to demonstrate a few moves. There’s no chance I’m going!</p>
<p>I and Rupert wanted to hide behind the curtains on the other side of the stadium, but the girls immediately found us.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_205434.png"></p>
<p>We got out quickly and joined the other boys.</p>
<p>Mr. Underwood chose me of course, somehow because I’m the skinniest in the class. So he could easily throw me without tiring himself. He showed the other boys some moves that had weird names, like “axle throw”, “singing handle” or “leg wrenches”.</p>
<p>When he was showing us a move called “firefighter”, I farted slightly. And then I knew it, my jumpsuit wasn’t really tight.</p>
<p>At that moment, I was so glad that the girls were on the OTHER side of the stadium.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_210053.png"></p>
<p>Mr. Underwood sorted us into weight groups. I felt really happy about that, because that meant I didn’t have to go against people who weighed 110 kilograms like Benny Wells.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-19_212930.png"></p>
<p>But then, when I knew who I was facing, I really wanted to switch for Benny Wells.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-19_213028.png"></p>
<p><em>Your partner would be Finley, Greg.</em></p>
<p>Finley was the only one in my weight group. And apparently he really paid attention when Mr. Underwood showed the moves. Because he wrecked me from every single side. For the whole hour, I REALLY got to know Finley.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-19_213228.png"></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday"><a href="#Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>All the wrestling classes really put our school upside-down. Now, the boys are wrestling in the classrooms, simply everywhere! But the first quarter of recess is the worst.</p>
<p>You can’t go two meters without seeing someone wrestling. I simply tried to avoid them. Because I swear to you, if it goes on like this, one of them will directly roll into the stinky cheese, and then everything with the cheese finger will continue.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_133020.png"></p>
<p>My other problem is that I have to wrestle with Finley every single day. But I thought of something this morning. When I enter a higher weight class, I don’t have to face Finley anymore.</p>
<p>So I stuffed my hoodie with every sock and shirt that I have, to try and get into a higher weight class.</p>
<p>But I was still too thin.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_133308.png"></p>
<p>That means, I had to really get heavier. At first I thought I would just drench myself with fast food, but then a much better idea came up.</p>
<p>I wanted MUSCLES, not fat.</p>
<p>I wasn’t really interested in getting fit, but all the wrestling business got me thinking about it.</p>
<p>If I exercise regularly now, maybe that’ll come in handy later on.</p>
<p>Because we’ll be playing football in PE in spring. And we are sorted into “shirts” and “naked-top” teams. And somehow, I ALWAYS lands in “naked-top”.</p>
<p>I think they do this just to see the unfit boys get embarassed about themselves.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_133807.png"></p>
<p>But if I could manage to grow muscles, things are definitely going to change in April.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_133858.png"></p>
<p><em>Greg Heffley, you’re playing in shirts.</em></p>
<p>Today I told mom and dad my plan after dinner. I said that I’ll be needing a few weights and equipments.</p>
<p>I showed them a magazine I bought, just to let them know how fit I wanted to go for.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_134058.png"></p>
<p>At first, mom didn’t say much about it, but dad found it great. I think he was just happy that my views have changed:</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_134155.png"></p>
<p><em>If you train, you’ll grow muscles!</em></p>
<p><em>Muscles are so awful!</em></p>
<p>but mom said, if I want to have barbells, I have to first prove that I can stand a full training program. She said I should do squats and push-ups for two weeks.</p>
<p>I tried to tell her that if you wanted to grow actual muscles, you have to use the high-tech equipments that gyms provided. But mom clearly didn’t want to know anything about that.</p>
<p>Dad said if I wanted a barbell, I should just wait until Christmas.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_134737.png"></p>
<p>But there’s still one-and-a-half months till Christmas, and if I face Finley again in PE, I’m gonna throw a fit.</p>
<p>Mom and dad are obviously no help at this point. So I’ll have to take matters into my own hands.</p>
<h3 id="Saturday"><a href="#Saturday" class="headerlink" title="Saturday"></a>Saturday</h3><p>I can’t wait to start with my body-building-program today. Even if mom didn’t want to buy the equipments, we could still somehow make it work.</p>
<p>so I looked in our fridge and emptied the two big buckets of milk and juice and filled them with sand. Then I taped them to a stick and there it is, my barbell!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-23_150622.png"></p>
<p>Then I got an ironing board and a few boxes and handcrafted a bench. And now, the program can start.</p>
<p>But I needed a training partner, so I called Rupert. But when he appeared in front of the door with this fully feminine sport suit, I immediately knew it was a grave mistake to call him over.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-23_151121.png"></p>
<p>I let Rupert try out the bench first, because I wanted to know if it could withstand the weight.</p>
<p>After about five minutes he wanted to quit, but I wasn’t gonna let that happen. And that’s when the training partner come in: to cheer one to their goal!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-23_151446.png"></p>
<p><em>Fifteen to go! Start!</em></p>
<p>I knew that Rupert wasn’t gonna take the whole thing as seriously as me, so I’m testing his endurance.</p>
<p>In the middle of his training session, I went and put on a fake mustache Rodrick used for his play.</p>
<p>And when Rupert was trying to lift upwards, I went into his view.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-23_152225.png"></p>
<p>Yup, Rupert TOTALLY lost his concentration. He couldn’t lift the barbell anymore. At first I wanted to help him, but then I realized it: If Rupert doesn’t take the training seriously, he’s not gonna reach the same level as me.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-24_094602.png"></p>
<p>Finally I freed him, after he tried, by biting the lids on the buckets and letting the sand out.</p>
<p>As Rupert finished, I was ready to go. But then he said that he’s not interested in training anymore and went home.</p>
<p>At the moment I thought it was nothing. You can’t have such high expectations on others than on yourself.</p>
<h3 id="Wednesday-1"><a href="#Wednesday-1" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>Today we had a test on geography, and I have to say, I’ve been waiting for it for a long time.</p>
<p>It was about the cities of the USA and I was sitting in the very back and happened to be (very conveniently) under a huge map, on which all the cities were written and exaggerated with a thick marker. Then I kenw it: it was pure happiness!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-24_095308.png"></p>
<p>But when the test was going, Patty Farrell in the first row suddenly started speaking.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-24_095433.png"></p>
<p><em>Teacher! Teacher!</em></p>
<p>And then she told Mr. Ira that he should cover the map before the test.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-24_095515.png"></p>
<p><em>Thanks for the tip, Patty!</em></p>
<p>And thanks to Patty I completely blew my exam. I’m definitely gonna get revenge on her some time!</p>
<h3 id="Thursday-2"><a href="#Thursday-2" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>Today, mom went into my room with a flyer in the hand. When I saw it, I IMMEDIATELY knew what was going on.</p>
<p>It was a notice that our school was going to put on a theater show in winter. Man, I should’ve thrown it away when I saw it on the kitchen table.</p>
<p>I BEGGED her not to let me participate. This school activity is almost always a musical, and the last thing I need is being forced sing alone in front of the whole school.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-24_100821.png"></p>
<p>But all my begging only deepened mom’s forcing me in.</p>
<p>Mom said that I’m only gonna be “versatile” if I try different things.</p>
<p>Dad came up to see what was happening. I said to him that mom was forcing me to join the activity, and if I still had to go to the rehearsal, I’m not gonna have extra time for the body building program.</p>
<p>I knew it: with that, dad was on my side. Mom and dad argued for a while, but dad usually is the loser in these conversations.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-24_101105.png"></p>
<p>So I’ll have to prepare for the performance tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="Friday"><a href="#Friday" class="headerlink" title="Friday"></a>Friday</h3><p>This year they opted for “The Wizard of Oz”. Many kids were already dressed up for the roles that they want to play. Because I still haven’t watched the movie, it sorta seemed like I landed in a madhouse.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-25_205723.png"></p>
<p>The music teacher, Mrs. Norton, wanted all of us to sing the national song in order to hear how we sound. I sang with other boys who were also forced here by their moms. I tried to be as quiet as possible, but she still picked me out of nowhere. Crap.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-25_205904.png"></p>
<p>I had absolutely no idea what a “sopran” is, but as long as the girls were giggling, it couldn’t be anything good.</p>
<p>The audition was horrible. At the end, it will be decided who will play Dorothy, who was obviously a main role.</p>
<p>And in the first place came no other than Patty Farrell!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-25_210419.png"></p>
<p>I suddenly had the idea to play the witch, because the witch was against Dorothy in every single way possible in the play.</p>
<p>But then others told me that there was a good witch and a bad witch, and they were going to let me play the good one.</p>
<h3 id="Monday"><a href="#Monday" class="headerlink" title="Monday"></a>Monday</h3><p>I hoped that Mrs. Norton wouldn’t select me, but today she said that everyone who auditioned will get a role. Great.</p>
<p>Mrs. Norton showed us the film, so everybody could go through the story. I wanted to decide who I’m going to play, but it doesn’t matter that much. Because every character had to sing or dance in some way. But, when we were halfway through, I finally knew who I wanted to play: a tree, because, one, the trees don’t have to sing, and two, they can bomb Dorothy with apples.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-25_211208.png"></p>
<p>For me, it was a lifelong dream of mine to be allowed to bomb Patty Farrell with apples in front of an audience. When this was at an end, I’m gonna have to thank my mom for forcing me in.</p>
<p>After the film ended, I signed up to be a tree. But unfortunately, quite a few of the other boys were thinking about the exact same thing. I suppose there’s quite a bit who want to make Patty Farrell into a chicken of some sort.</p>
<h3 id="Wednesday-2"><a href="#Wednesday-2" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>Yeah, just like what mom said: “Go for what you wish.” I’m now auditioning for a tree, but I don’t know if it’s a great idea anymore. The tree costumes don’t have any arm holes, so that means nothing with the apple throwing.</p>
<p>I should be glad that I got a role in time. Because there were too many candidates and not enough roles, they started to create roles.</p>
<p>Phillip James originally wanted to be the tin man, but now he’s playing a bush.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-28_200543.png"></p>
<h3 id="Friday-1"><a href="#Friday-1" class="headerlink" title="Friday"></a>Friday</h3><p>Did I say anything about being glad that I had a role? Today I realized, I only have a few words in the whole thing. For example, this is what I’m going to say when Dorothy picks an apple from my branch:</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-28_200709.png"></p>
<p>In other words: I have to sit here for two hours a day, only to say a few boring words.</p>
<p>Now I’m starting to think that Phillip James got lucky with the bush. He found out how to smuggle video games in there. With that, time definitely passes quicker.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-28_201119.png"></p>
<p>So I tried to deliberately mess up, so Mrs. Norton could replace me. But when you only have a few words to work with, it’s really hard to do so.</p>
