        <h3 id="1"><a href="#1" class="headerlink" title="1"></a>1</h3><p>First, there was the smell of blood and coffee. The coffee machine is there on the desk, and the blood is in my shoe. To be honest, it’s not only blood. When the elderly said “fourteen”, I peed my pants. I sat diagonally on the stool without moving the whole time. I was dizzy. I tried to think about how Tschick would be like when a “fourteen” hit him in the face, and then I peed my pants out of fear. Maik Klingenberg, the hero. I don’t really know where the hype came from. It was clear that the whole thing came to an end. Tschick definitely wouldn’t piss himself.</p>
<p>Where is Tschick? I didn’t see him on the road, like him with one leg bouncing into a bush, but once I think about it, he has to fight against it. You can’t go far with only one leg. I definitely couldn’t ask the police. Because, if they didn’t see him, it is logically better to not even mention the thing. Maybe they didn’t see him after all. And they’re not gonna get a word out of me. Then they can torture me. Although the German police, I believe, aren’t allowed to torture people. That can only happen on TV or in Turkey.</p>
<p>But sitting in the police station all dirty and blood-covered while answering question from others just isn’t it. Maybe torturing would be a bit better, then I would at least have an explanation for all this excitement.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is keep your mouth shut, Tschick said taht. And I see the same. Now, where everything is pointless. And I don’t care about a single thing. Well, almost. Tatjana Cosic, for example, isn’t “a single thing”. Even though I haven’t thought of her for a really long time. But when I sit on this very stool and look at the road outside and with the older police standing by the coffee machine back there for five minutes, filling water and dumping it out, reaching under the counter and trying to see what’s wrong when every literal dumbass can clearly tell that the plug of the extension cable isn’t plugged, I have to think about Tatjana again. Because, if it weren’t for her, I wouldn’t be here. Although she has nothing to do with the whole thing. Am I speaking a bit unclear? Sorry for that. I’m gonna try later. Tatjana doesn’t come up in the whole story. The most beautiful girl in the whole world has no role in this. On the whole trip, I always imagined that she could see us. How we stomped through the corn field. How we stood on the rubbish pile with a bunch of hoses in our hands like the last two fools in the world… I always imagined that Tatjana was behind us, and she was seeing everything we saw, and she felt excited just like we did. But now, I’m only glad that was something I made up.</p>
<p>The police took a piece of green tissue from the tissue box and gave it to me. What should I do with it? Mop the floor? He squeezes his nose with two fingers and look at me. Oh, nose sneezing. I sneezed my nose, and he smiled. That, I could tell apart from torture. I look around the floor. The whole station was laid out with green linoleum, just like the entrance hall in our school. It smells a bit like that. Piss, sweat and linoleum. I can see our PE teacher, Wolkow, in a training suit, springing across the hall, seventy years old, and training: Let’s go, boys! Hop, Hop! The noise from his smacking steps on the ground, and the giggling straight out of the girl’s toilet. I can see the high windows, the benches, the rings on the ceiling. I can see Natalie and Lena and Kimberley enter the hall from the side entrance. And Tatjana in her green training suit. I see her reflection on the hall floor, The glittering pants that girls always wear, and the upper piece. And that half of them do gymnastics with wool pullovers on and at least three have a medical certificate. Hagecius-Middle-School Berlin, eighth class.</p>
<p>“I thought, fifteen?” I said, and the police shaked his head.</p>
<p>“No, fourteen. Fourteen. What’s up with the coffee, Horst?”</p>
<p>“The machine’s broken.” Horst said.</p>
<p>I want to speak to my lawyer.</p>
<p>That was the sentence, that I had to somehow say. That’s the right sentence in the right situation, just like how everyone knew from the TV. But it’s so easy: I want to speak to my lawyer. They’re gonna laugh their heads out. The problem is: I don’t know what this sentence menas. When I say, I want to speak to my lawyer, and they ask: “To whom you want to speak? <em>Your lawyer?</em>“ What should I answer then? I haven’t seen a single lawyer in my life, and I also don’t know, why would I be needing one. I don’t know what’s the difference between an attorney, a lawyer and a prosecutor. I’ll just take that it’s something similar to a judge, but he stands on my side and knows more about laws than me. But practically everybody in the room knows more about laws than me. And I could naturally ask them. But I know, if I ask the younger one, whether I need such a lawyer right now, he’ll just call out to his colleagues: “Hey, Horst! Horshi! Come over here! Our hero wants to know whether he needs a lawyer or not! Look at him. Blood shed all over the floor, pissed himself just like a world champion and – want’s to speak to <em>his lawyer</em>!” Hahaha. Then they’re gonna laugh until they’re broken. And I find my experience already horrible enough, I really don’t need myself insulted. What happened, happened. And nothing more. The lawyer can’t do anyting about that either. Because only a psycho could try to deny that we’ve been crap. What should I say? That I stayed at home, in our pool the whole week, you can ask the janitor? That pork sides fell from the sky like crazy? I really can’t do much know. I can still pray to Mecca and shit myself in the pants, other than that, options really are limited.</p>
<p>The younger, who actually seemed nice at first, shook his head again and repeated: “Fifteen is nonsense. Fourteen. You’re responsible for crime from fourteen.”</p>
<p>Somehow, I should feel guilty and remorseful and stuff like that, but, to be honest, I don’t feel anything. I’m just crazily dizzy. I’m scratching myself by my calf. Only there, where my calf was, isn’t anymore. A red stripe is across my hand. That’s not <em>my</em> blood, I said earlier, when they asked me. There are random shit laying on the street ready for people to mess around with, and I really thought that wasn’t my blood. But if it isn’t my blood, where is my calf?</p>
<p>I roll up my pants and look at what’s under me. I had just a second to stare at the scene. If I saw that in a movie, I’m gonna feel horrible, and in fact, I am kinda nasty right now, in this surprisingly quiet road police station. I saw my reflection on the linoleum, and then it banged, and I’m going.</p>

        <h3 id="Wednesday"><a href="#Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>Today, it snowed for the first time this year and school was closed. We originally had a math test, but with the whole school guide thing, I’ve been slacking off a bit. So I was extremely happy.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-05_142919.png"></p>
<p>I called Rupert and told him to come. We’ve been wanting to build the biggest snowman in the world for a couple few years.</p>
<p>And when I say the biggest snowman in the world, I mean the it. We want it to be in the Guinness records.</p>
<p>But every time we wanted to start the project, the snow starts melting, and winter is officially gone. This year is the perfect chance.</p>
<p>We began as soon as Rupert arrived by rolling out some balls. In my plan, the balls should be at least three meters high, if we actually want to break the world record. But they are turn heavier as we keep rolling. And we have to take a break now and then.</p>
<p>When we were pausing, mom came outside and wanted drive to the supermarket, but our snowball was in the way. So she did us a favor.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-05_143812.png"></p>
<p><em>Ach! It’s heavy!</em></p>
<p>After the break we went on with the rolling, until we were unable to make the balls any bigger. Then we carefully observed our piece of work for the first time, and saw, what a catastrophe we’ve created.</p>
<p>The snowball was so heavy, dad’s garden, which he planted last autumn, stuck onto it.</p>
<p>I hoped for a few more centimeters of snow to cover up the scene of the crime, but the snow suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Our plan the build the largest snowman in the world is starting to fall apart. But I thought of a better plan for the snowballs.</p>
<p>When it snows, the kids always comes onto Whirley Street to snowboard.</p>
<p>That means, tomorrow, when the kids come out again, I and Rupert will teach them a lesson.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-13_203207.png"></p>
<h3 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>When I waked up today, the snow had already started to melt. So I called Rupert and said that he should come straight to me.</p>
<p>When I was waiting for Rupert, I watched Manni trying to build a snowman out of the few bits of pieces we left when we were rolling our giant snowball.</p>
<p>It was really a tragic play.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-13_203541.png"></p>
<p>I can’t think of anything more unlucky than dad looking out of the window right that moment.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-13_203636.png"></p>
<p>Dad was ALREADY a bit angry at me, because I ruined his lawn, so I knew right then: angry he is! I heard the garage door go up. Dad came, armed with a snow shovel, and I was thinking, I should find a better place for my grave than this.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-13_204227.png"></p>
<p>But dad didn’t come towards me, but toward my snowball. And in less than a minute, my work turned to nothing.</p>
<p>In a few minutes, Rupert came. I thought, maybe he would think it’s funny.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-13_204349.png"></p>
<p>But he was really excited about rolling the thing down the street, because he suddenly turned sour. And the unbelievable happened: Rupert was angry to ME, because of something MY DAD did.</p>
<p>If my teacher, Mrs. Levine was there, she would probably say that the whole thing had an “ironic” touch.</p>
<h3 id="Thursday-1"><a href="#Thursday-1" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>I and Rupert decided to create our own comic. After school he went to mine and we started with the work.</p>
<p>We created the characters with ease. But when it went on to the part when we had to make up jokes, we could’t go on.</p>
<p>Suddenly I had an idea.</p>
<p>I found a comic with the character saying “oh mama” every single time.</p>
<p>So we didn’t have to think about the lines anymore, and could concentrate on the pictures.</p>
<p>I did the writing and drawing for the first few comics and Rupert colored them in.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-18_145124.png"></p>
<p><em>If you step on a crack, it’ll bring you back luck!</em></p>
<p><em>Ok, whatever.</em></p>
<p><em>Hey Timmy, your mom tripped on a banana peel and p.s. She’s dead.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh mama!</em></p>
<p>To be honest, the quality of the comics quickly went down when Rupert did the writing.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-18_145717.png"></p>
<p><em>I’ve been waiting for a hamburger for three hours.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally! A hamburger, please!</em></p>
<p><em>Sorry, burgers are out.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh mama!</em></p>

        <h3 id="Wednesday"><a href="#Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>Now I know what I can do with the Big Wheel that Rupert gave me for Christmas. I created a game where someone drives around and the other tries to hit them with a football.</p>
<p>First was Rupert the Driver and I the thrower.</p>
<p>It’s a lot harder than I thought to meet the goal. Other than that, I didn’t have much time to practice. After every start, it took Rupert about ten minutes to get back on track.</p>
<p>Rupert wanted to switch constantly and let me also try the car. But I’m not interested. The thing went down hill in about fifty parts and there were no brakes!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-07_210858.png"></p>
<p><em>You don’t wanna try it?</em></p>
<p><em>No thanks…You can do it a lot better!</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I didn’t succeed in getting Rupert off the Big Wheel for a single time today. But at least I had something to do for the rest of the Christmas break.</p>
<h3 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>I wanted to go to Rupert’s today to play the Big-Wheel-game again, but mom said that I had to write my Christmas gratitude letters first before I could go anywhere.</p>
<p>I thought that I’m gonna finish it easily in half an hour, but when it came to the actual writing, there was nothing in my brain.</p>
<p>It’s really not easy to show gratitude for things you don’t want at all.</p>
<p>I started with the people that didn’t give me a sweater, because I thought those would be easier. But after two or three letters I gave up and decided that I’m gonna write more or less every time.</p>
<p>So I found a pre-made letter form online and left spaces for the necessary changes. And then it became a lot easier.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-07_212203.png"></p>
<p><em>Dear Aunt Lydia,</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you so much for the great lexicon!</em></p>
<p><em>How did you know I wanted that for Christmas?</em></p>
<p><em>The lexicon looks great on my bookshelf!</em></p>
<p><em>My friends would definitely envy me, when I have my own lexicon.</em></p>
<p><em>I hope you have the best Christmas ever!</em></p>
<p><em>Your Greg</em></p>
<p>It worked great for the first few gifts, but as I went on, it got off track a bit.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-18_210403.png"></p>
<p><em>Dear Aunt Loretta,</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you so much for the great pants!</em></p>
<p><em>How did you know I wanted that for Christmas?</em></p>
<p><em>The pants looks great in my legs!</em></p>
<p><em>My friends would definitely envy me, when I have my own pants.</em></p>
<p><em>I hope you have the best Christmas ever!</em></p>
<p><em>Your Greg</em></p>
<h3 id="Friday"><a href="#Friday" class="headerlink" title="Friday"></a>Friday</h3><p>Today, I finally managed to hit Robert on the Big Wheel, but from then it didn’t go as I thought. I wanted to hit him in the shoulder, but I wasn’t accurate enough and the football ended up landing under the tricycle.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-18_210914.png"></p>
<h3 id="Monday"><a href="#Monday" class="headerlink" title="Monday"></a>Monday</h3><p>The Christmas holidays are gone and school officially starts today. Are you still worrying about Rupert and the tricycle accident? He broke his hand. And now he’s wearing a cast. And today everyone was around him, like he’s a hero or something.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-20_153539.png"></p>
<p><em>Does it still hurt?</em></p>
<p><em>Well, a bit.</em></p>
<p><em>You poor little thing!</em></p>
<p>I tried to steal Rupert’s show, but it worked the opposite way.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-20_153824.png"></p>
<p><em>I’m the one that broke his arm!</em></p>
<p><em>You devil!</em></p>
<p>At lunch, a couple of girls invited Rupert to their desks, to FEED him.</p>
<p>What annoyed me the most, was that Rupert is a right-hander and broke his LEFT hand! He can feed himself no problem.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-20_155135.png"></p>
<p><em>Here comes the plane!</em></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday"><a href="#Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Rupert’s arm inspired me. I thought, I needed one of those myself.</p>
<p>I found some rubbish bags at home and wrapped my hand with them.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize that the girls wouldn’t treat me like Rupert, but then I understood the situation.</p>
<p>If you have an actual cast, everyone would want to write their name on it. But a marker doesn’t work too good on a plastic bag.</p>
<p>So I found another solution to the problem, and, to be honest, it worked great!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-25_133729.png"></p>
<p><em>Do you want to be the first to sign?</em></p>
<p>But that went down the drain. My arm attracted some people and they wanted to examine it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-25_133921.png"></p>
<p><em>Can I see your arm?</em></p>
<p><em>Stop right there.</em></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday-1"><a href="#Tuesday-1" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Last weak the new semester started, so now we have some new subjects. One of which was “unconstant group work”.</p>
<p>I WANTED to join group 2, because I was already doing great in group 1.</p>
<p>But as a boy, being able to sew doesn’t get you a whole lot of popularity.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-25_134217.png"></p>
<p><em>Look! Gref has a purse!</em></p>
<p><em>That’s a self-made book bag.</em></p>
<p><em>Fine, still a purse.</em></p>
<p>This subject was an experiment, and they’re trying it out in our school for the first time.</p>
<p>The idea is that every class gets a project and we work on it in groups without teachers for the whole semester.</p>
<p>The flaw in the plan is that everyone in the group gets the same grade at the end. When I was told that Ricky Fischer was in my group, I knew it was trouble.</p>
<p>Ricky is mainly known for the things he do, such as collecting old gum stuck under his desk and eating them mindlesly. So I definitely am not expecting anything high for our group.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-25_134641.png"></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday-2"><a href="#Tuesday-2" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Today, we got the task for our group project, and guess what it is? We’re supposed to build a robot! At first, everyone was overwhelmed, because we thought, we had to make an actual robot all by ourselves.</p>
<p>But Mr. Darnell explained to us that we don’t have build real ones. We only have to design the appearance and the functions.</p>
<p>Then he went out of the classroom and we were on our own. We started by collecting some ideas. I wrote the suggestions on the board.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-29_210712.png"></p>
<p><em>The robot should: do homework do the dishes make breakfast brush teeth</em></p>
<p>The others were impressed by my ideas, but it wasn’t hard at all. I just wrote all the stuff I didn’t like to do.</p>
<p>Then a few girls went up and wrote their own ideas. They wiped mine and wrote theirs instead.</p>
<p>They wanted a robot that can give out fashion tips and has ten different shades of lip gloss for the ten fingers.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-29_210934.png"></p>
<p>We boys thought that was the worst idea of all times. So we divided ourselves into two groups: boys and girls. The boys went to the other side of the classroom, when the girls stood still and chatted.</p>
<p>Now that we had the people who seriously wanted to work, we started. Someone suggested that the robot should be able to repeat any name told to it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-29_211341.png"></p>
<p><em>Hello, BOB. It’s nice to meet you, BOB.</em></p>
<p>But then someone said, you shouldn’t use swear words as names, because the robot isn’t allowed to swear. So we decided to make a list of the swear words that the robot shouldn’t be able to use.</p>
<p>We wrote out all the normal ones, but then Ricky Fischer somehow knew twenty more which none of us have ever heard before.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-29_211623.png"></p>
<p>So, Ricky was the most worthy participant of the project in the end.</p>
<p>Before long, Mr. Darnell came back to see how we were going. He found our list and looked through.</p>
<p>To make things short, there won’t be any “unconstant group work” for this semester.</p>
<p>At least not for us boys. If all the robots have lip-glosses as fingers in the future, you’ll know how it came to that.</p>
<h3 id="Thursday-1"><a href="#Thursday-1" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>Today, there was a school meeting to watch the movie “I think I’m great!”. We watch it every single year.</p>
<p>The movie basically tells you that you should be satisfied with who you are and you shouldn’t try to deliberately change yourself.</p>
<p>To be honest, I think it’s totally wrong for kids, especially for my school.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_152808.png"></p>
<p>Then they said that they were looking for student guides. That got me an idea.</p>
<p>If someone gets into a fight with a student guide, they could end up being expelled. The way I see it, a little extra security doesn’t do any harm.</p>
<p>Other than that, I think a bit of authority could do me good.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_153258.png"></p>
<p><em>Could we please cross the street now?</em></p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p><em>But we’ve been standing here for an hour!</em></p>
<p>So I went to Mr. Winter’s office and applied for the job, and I also talked Rupert into it. I thought, we had to do high knees or push-ups or something to get the job, but he just gave us the badges and the ribbons.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_153544.png"></p>
<p>Then he said, there was a special order for us. Next to our school, there’s a primary school and for some reason there’s a bunch of kindergarten kids in there.</p>
<p>Mr. Winter wants us to escort the kids home at noon. I caught the meaning immediately: we could skip twenty minutes of math! Rupert wanted to say something, but I stomped his feet under the desk like crazy before he could finish his sentence.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_153905.png"></p>
<p><em>But then we’re gonna miss OOOUUUCH!</em></p>
<p>I couldn’t believe my luck. I got extra protection and an excuse to skip a half of my math session, without having to do anything!</p>
<h3 id="Tuesday-3"><a href="#Tuesday-3" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Today was our first day as student guides. I and Rupert didn’t have specific positions like the others, so we didn’t have to stand in the cold for a whole hour.</p>
<p>But we still picked up some hot kakao, which were distributed to all the student guides before the first session.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_154549.png"></p>
<p>What’s more: we could go to the first period ten minutes later.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-05-04_155015.png"></p>
<p>This school guide thing is really sick!</p>
<p>At 12:15, I left class with Rupert to guide the kindergarten kids to home. The whole thing took three quarters, and when we returned, there’s only 20 minutes math left.</p>
<p>Guiding the kids back home was no problem. But one of them started to sniff all weird midway, and I knew right away that something happened.</p>
<p>He wanted to say something, but I just didn’t pay attention to him and went on. I only bring them home, but I’m not responsible for anything else! No way!</p>

        <h3 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>It’s only a few days till the performance, and I still have no idea how we can make this work.</p>
<p>First, nobody took the actual efforts to learn their roles. And Mrs. Norton is sour about it.</p>
<p>During rehearsal, she’s always hinting the lines.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_144943.png"></p>
<p>Well, I don’t know how it’s gonna work next Tuesday, if Mrs. Norton has to stay ten meters away from the piano.</p>
<p>Other than that, it’s spreading between us that Mrs. Norton is still creating new scenes and figures.</p>
<p>Yesterday, she decided that a first grader will play Dorothy’s dog: Toto. But today, the boy’s mother came and wanted her son upright, because it’s “shameful” to be on all fours.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_145559.png"></p>
<p>Now, we have a dog that’s running on it’s back legs all the time.</p>
<p>But the worst change is that Mrs. Norton composed a song for the TREES. She said that everyone who joined should be “allowed” to sing a song.</p>
<p>So today, we sang the most horrible song of all times for a whole hour.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_145949.png"></p>
<p><em>We are three trees…</em></p>
<p>Thank god Rodrick wasn’t coming to see this absolute catastrophe. Mrs. Norton said, the performance was going to take place in our hall, and I knew, Rodrick would never give up time for a school performance.</p>
<p>But there are good news today. Towards the end of rehearsal, Andy Kelly stomped over Philip James and lost a corner of a tooth, because he couldn’t support his body with his arms.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_150350.png"></p>
<p>The good news is, we’re finally getting armholes in our costumes.</p>
<h3 id="Tuesday"><a href="#Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Today was the great performance of “The Wizard of Oz”! Before it started, there were already a few signs showing that this wasn’t gonna go smooth.</p>
<p>I peeked through the curtains to see how many people were coming and who was there in the first row? My brother Rodrick, even with a tie!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_150921.png"></p>
<p>It was clear then, that I had to sing, and I had to sing with shame. The performance should’ve started at 8, but there was a delay because Philip James suddenly got stage fright.</p>
<p>At first, you would think that when one only needs to quietly sit on the ground and do absolutely nothing, he could hold it for an introduction’s time. But Philip was sweating a whole lot and had to be carried to his parents finally.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_151351.png"></p>
<p>The introduction finally began at half past eight. Just as I said, no one was able to recite their lines, and Mrs. Norton had to run back and forth between the backstage and her piano. The little boy who played Toto needed a stool and a bunch of comic books on the stage, so the part with the dog was totally ruined.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_151836.png"></p>
<p>When the forest scene came, I went into position with the other trees. The curtains went up and right this moment I heard Manni yell.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_152050.png"></p>
<p>Oh, great. I successfully hid this nickname for five years, and now the whole city knows it. I got about 300 eyes on me.</p>
<p>So I improvised a bit and got it on Andy Kelly.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-30_152234.png"></p>
<p><em>You lost an apple, “Bubi”.</em></p>
<p>But the biggest embarrassment was yet to came. When Mrs. Norton played the first note of “We are Three Trees”, my heartbeat suddenly got to my nose.</p>
<p>I looked into the hall and there sat Rodrick with a video camera.</p>
<p>I knew, if Rodrick filmed me when I’m singing, he’s gonna show it to everyone and destroy my life.</p>
<p>I didn’t have a single idea what I should do. And when the first line came, I simply shut my mouth close.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_114850.png"></p>
<p><em>We are three trees…</em></p>
<p>Everything went by in the blink of an eye. I thought, if I didn’t actually sing, Rodrick would have nothing against me in his hand. But soon, the other trees noticed I wasn’t singing.</p>
<p>Maybe they thought I was somehow foxier than then, so they also quieted down.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_115100.png"></p>
<p>We three just stood there and didn’t say a single word. Mrs. Norton thought we forgot the lyrics, because she came under the stage from the piano and sang the rest.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_115158.png"></p>
<p>The song only lasted three minutes, but it felt more like thirty. I only wanted the curtains to fall down again and we can quietly stand on stage.</p>
<p>But then I saw Patty Farrell about to go up behind the curtains. If you ignore the blinks, we were three dead trees. And she thought we’ve ruined her hollywood career or something.</p>
<p>But when I saw her standing there, I suddenly realized why I wanted to be a tree in the first place.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_115443.png"></p>
<p>Soon, the other trees were also throwing apples at her. I think even Toto joined us.</p>
<p>Someone knocked Patty’s glasses off her nose and one of the lenses broke. After that, Mrs. Norton had to abruptly end the performance, because Patty couldn’t see a thing without her glasses.</p>
<p>When it ended, I went straight home with my family. But she threw it away when we were exiting.</p>
<p>I hope that others in the hall would find the performance just as funny as I have.</p>
<h3 id="Wednesday"><a href="#Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>The performance definitely did one thing for good: I don’t have to worry about the nickname “Bubi” anymore.</p>
<p>After the fifth session, I saw how they pushed Andy Kelly to the ground. That means, I can finally throw all this behind me.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_120009.png"></p>
<p><em>How’s it going, “Bubi”?</em></p>
<h3 id="Sunday"><a href="#Sunday" class="headerlink" title="Sunday"></a>Sunday</h3><p>After all that in school, I didn’t really have any time to think about the upcoming Christmas. And it’s only ten days away.</p>
<p>I only realized that Christmas is just outside the door when Rodrick sticked his wish list on the fridge.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_120146.png"></p>
<p><em>Rodrick’s wish list</em></p>
<p><em>1. new drums</em></p>
<p><em>2. new minibus</em></p>
<p><em>3. shrunken head</em></p>
<p>Usually I make a really long wish list for Christmas, but this year, I only wanted a video game called “Twisted Wizard”.</p>
<p>Today, Manni went through the Christmas catalog and marked everything he wanted with a thick red marker. Manni circled every single toy there is in there. He even marked a really expensive thing, I think it was an electric car or something like that.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_120359.png"></p>
<p>So I decided to write some advice to him, as an older brother.</p>
<p>I told him that if he circled things that are too expensive, he’s only gonna end up getting sweaters for Christmas. I said, he should choose three or four things that were average-priced, so he could at least get something he actually wanted in the end.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_120913.png"></p>
<p>But of course, Manni insisted on marking basically everything. Well then, he’ll have to learn from experiencing.</p>
<p>When I was seven, I only wished for a Barbie Dream House. And it’s totally NOT because I like girl’s toys as Rodrick claimed.</p>
<p>I only found it suitable for all my toy soldiers.</p>
<p>When Mom and Dad saw my wish list, they had a huge fight over it. Dad said he’s never going to buy me a puppet house, but mom found it good for me to “try out” new types of toys.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_121238.png"></p>
<p>Believe it or not: it was an actual fight that dad won! Dad said to me that I should make a new list with toys “appropriate” for boys.</p>
<p>But I have my secret weapon for Christmas. My uncle Charlie always buys me stuff I want. So I said to him that I wanted a Barbie Dream House, and he said of course he’s gonna buy it.</p>
<p>But when Charlie surprised me with his present at Christmas, it was NOT what I was hoping for. I think he went to a toy shop and simply bought the first thing he saw under the category “Barbie”.</p>
<p>When you see this picture of me holding a beach Barbie in the hand, you’ll know why.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_121645.png"></p>
<p>Dad wasn’t happy when he saw what uncle Charlie gave me. He said, I should either throw it away or sell it.</p>
<p>But I held on to the Barbie. And I’ll admit it, maybe I played with it for once or twice.</p>
<p>So two weeks later, I went to the clinic with a pink Barbie shoe shoved in the nose. And believe me, Rodrick would never forget that moment.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-31_122224.png"></p>
<h3 id="Thursday-1"><a href="#Thursday-1" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>Today I went with mom to the church to sort out a present for the christmas tree. The thing with the christmas tree is like a dream come true, where people gift the poor something special.</p>
<p>Mom found a red pullover for our “christmas-tree-guy”.</p>
<p>I wanted to persuade mom into buying something cooler, a TV or a ice cream machine or something.</p>
<p>I mean, your only Christmas present is a wool pullover.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-04_145121.png"></p>
<p>I’m pretty sure the guy’s gonna throw it straight into the trash.</p>
<h3 id="Christmas"><a href="#Christmas" class="headerlink" title="Christmas"></a>Christmas</h3><p>This year, about one million gifts were under the tree. But as I went through them, I realised that there were almost none with my name on it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-04_145241.png"></p>
<p>But Manni totally got on the gravy train. He got EVERYTHING that he marked on the catalog! Not joking. He’s definitely happy that he didn’t listen to me back then.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-04_145357.png"></p>
<p>I found a few things with my name on it, but they were mainly books and socks and so.</p>
<p>I packed my gifts in the corner behind the sofa, because I didn’t want to open them near my dad. Because when someone unpacks a gift, dad always gets up immediately and cleans the paper.</p>
<p>I gave Manni a helicopter and Rodrick a book about rock bands. Rodrick also gifted me a book, but his is obviously not wrapped. The book was “The Best of Little Putzi”. “Little Putzi” is a totally crooked newspaper comic, and Rodrick knows, how much I hate it. I think it’s the fourth Christmas he’s gave me something about it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_133808.png"></p>
<p>Then I surprised mom and dad with their gifts.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_133915.png"></p>
<p>The other relatives began arriving. And then uncle Charlie came.</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie had a big rubbish bag full of gifts and mine was the first one that he grabbed out.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_134510.png"></p>
<p>The package was just the right size for the “Twisted Wizard” video game. I knew then, that uncle Charlie wasn’t gonna leave me in pain. Mom turned on the camera and I ripped open the present.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_134620.png"></p>
<p>But it was only a 20 × 30 cm picture of uncle Charlie.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_134658.png"></p>
<p>I didn’t control my reaction there, so mom was kinda sour. I can only say that I’m happy to be a kid, because when I look at the gifts the adults get, I don’t know if I could pretend to be happy.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_135046.png"></p>
<p><em>cosy home</em></p>
<p><em>I know EXACTLY where to hang this!</em></p>
<p><em>I KNEW you would like it!</em></p>
<p>So I went up into my room to get a little alone time. A few minutes later, my dad was knocking at the door. He said that there was still a present for me in the garage, and that was because it was too big for wrapping.</p>
<p>And when I went with him into the garage, a brand new barbell set was standing there.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_135248.png"></p>
<p>That thing must’ve costed a fortune! I really didn’t want to tell my dad that I don’t have such passion with bodybuilding anymore, since we were finished with wrestling last week. So I simply said: “Thanks.”</p>
<p>Dad was, I’m pretty sure, expecting me to lay on the thing right away and start lifting, but I apologised quickly and went up again.</p>
<p>Three hours later, the relatives were gone.</p>
<p>I sat on the couch, with Manni by my side, playing with his new stuff, and felt rotten. Then, mom came and said she found a gift with my name on it behind the piano: “From Santa”</p>
<p>The packaging was too big for the video game, but mom already used the trick with the too-big package last year when she bought me a memory card for my game console.</p>
<p>So I ripped open the package and took out my present. But this time it wasn’t “Twisted Wizard” either. It was an ugly red pullover.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_135831.png"></p>
<p>At first I thought that mom wanted to prank me, because we gave our “Christmas-tree-guy” the exact same thing.</p>
<p>But mom seemed to be confused also. She said, she ACTUALLY bought the game for me, and has no idea why I got a sweater.</p>
<p>Then I realized. I told mom that there had had to be a mix-up somewhere. I got the gift for the “Christmas-tree-guy” and he got mine.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_140125.png"></p>
<p>Mom said, she used the same wrapping paper for both packages and maybe put the wrong name on them.</p>
<p>But then mom said that it’s still great because the guy would definitely be happy about the gift.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_140233.png"></p>
<p><em>It’s a Christmas wonder!</em></p>
<p>I had to explain to her that you needed a game console and a TV to play “Twisted Wizard”, which meant he couldn’t play it even if he got it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_140323.png"></p>
<p>Even though my Christmas didn’t go great, it’s definitely more horrible for the guy.</p>
<p>Then I kinda lost interest in this year’s Christmas and decided to go to Rupert’s.</p>
<p>I forgot to buy Rupert a present, so i just put a bow on the “Little Putzi” book that Rodrick gave me.</p>
<p>it worked perfectly.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_140824.png"></p>
<p>Rupert’s parents had a lot of money, so they always gave out great presents.</p>
<p>But Rupert said, he found a gift by himself for me this year. So he went out with me to show me.</p>
<p>For some reason, I thought he was gonna buy me a TV or a motorcycle or something.</p>
<p>Just like every other time, my hopes were way too high.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_141206.png"></p>
<p>Rupert buy me a tricycle. It was a really cool gift, but now, I have absolutely no idea of what I should do with it.</p>
<p>But Rupert was so excited, so I tried to pretend.</p>
<p>We went in again, so Rupert could show me what gifts he got.</p>
<p>He definitely got more than me. He even got the “Twisted Wizard” video game, so I could at least come here and play. At least before his dad notices how brutal the game is.</p>
<p>And I’m telling you, I haven’t seen anyone get so lucky as Rupert with his “Little Putzi” book. His mom said, it was the only thing he didn’t get on his wish list.</p>
<p>At least SOMEONE got one thing they wanted.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-06_142004.png"></p>
<p><em>It’s a Christmas wonder!</em></p>
<h3 id="Silvester"><a href="#Silvester" class="headerlink" title="Silvester"></a>Silvester</h3><p>Just in case you’re wondering, why I’m sitting in my room at 9 o’clock on Silvester, I’ll explain it now.</p>
<p>Earlier I and Manni were in the basement. I found a small black object on the carpet and he said it’s a spinner.</p>
<p>Then I grabbed the spinner over his head and acted as if I was gonna force him to eat it.</p>
<p>When I wanted to let Manni away, he pushed my arm and I let the thing fall. And can you guess what happened next? He swallowed it!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-04-07_204239.png"></p>
<p>Yeah, then he totally freaked out. He ran up to find mom, and I knew it, now I’m definitely dead.</p>
<p>Manni told mom I threatened him to eat the spinner. I told her it wasn’t a spinner and just lint.</p>
<p>Mom let Manni to the kitchen table. There she put out a seed, a raisin and a grape on a plate and said, that Manni should show her how big the lint was.</p>
<p>Manni stared at the plate for a bit.</p>
<p>Then he went to the fridge and took out an orange.</p>
<p>yeah, then she sent me back to my room at 19 o’clock, instead of letting me watch the Silvester shows downstairs.</p>
<p>And my only wish for next year, is to not play with Manni.</p>

        </div>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
      
        <h3 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>Today, we went by grandma’s house with the school bus. Someone covered it with toilet paper last night, I wasn’t really surprised about it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_203315.png"></p>
<p>Somehow I felt sorry, because it’s definitely gonna take a long time to clean it up. On the other hand, grandma definitely hasn’t experienced anything like this as a retiree.</p>
<h3 id="Wednesday"><a href="#Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>In the third hour, our PE teacher Mr. Underwood announced that the boys are going to learn wrestling for the next six weeks.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing boys at my school are good at, it’s wrestling. Mr. Underwood kinda threw a bomb into the crowd there.</p>
<p>After PE we had recess and the cafeteria was a pure madhouse.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_203645.png"></p>
<p>No idea how the school thought when they decided to teach wrestling.</p>
<p>I’ve decided that if I don’t want to get slammed in the next one-and-a-half month, I should finish my homework better, especially anything regarding wrestling.</p>
<p>So I lent two wrestling video games and wanted to learn a few tricks. After a few moments, I think I’ve got it.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_204215.png"></p>
<p><em>Does that feel rightt?</em></p>
<p><em>YES! NO! HELP!</em></p>
<p>The other boys in my class should be more careful, because if this goes on, I can be really dangerous.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_204643.png"></p>
<p>On the other hand, I don’t want to be TOO good. A boy called Andy Loch was sporter of the month for once, because he played best in the basketball tournament, and they hung up his picture in the corridors.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_204817.png"></p>
<p>It took them about five seconds to check how “A. Loch” sounds when someone says it loud, and that was it for Andy.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_204915.png"></p>
<h3 id="Thursday-1"><a href="#Thursday-1" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>Today I realized that the type of wrestling Mr. Underwood talked about is TOTALLY different from the one in the TV.</p>
<p>First, you had to put on a thing called “jumpsuit”, which looked incredibly similar to the typical 1800s swimwear.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_205138.png"></p>
<p>There weren’t any rings with lines on the edge. Essentially, it was just a sweaty mat that looked ancient, as if it had been used for a long time.</p>
<p>The hour began with Mr. Underwood trying to find a volunteer to demonstrate a few moves. There’s no chance I’m going!</p>
<p>I and Rupert wanted to hide behind the curtains on the other side of the stadium, but the girls immediately found us.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_205434.png"></p>
<p>We got out quickly and joined the other boys.</p>
<p>Mr. Underwood chose me of course, somehow because I’m the skinniest in the class. So he could easily throw me without tiring himself. He showed the other boys some moves that had weird names, like “axle throw”, “singing handle” or “leg wrenches”.</p>
<p>When he was showing us a move called “firefighter”, I farted slightly. And then I knew it, my jumpsuit wasn’t really tight.</p>
<p>At that moment, I was so glad that the girls were on the OTHER side of the stadium.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-18_210053.png"></p>
<p>Mr. Underwood sorted us into weight groups. I felt really happy about that, because that meant I didn’t have to go against people who weighed 110 kilograms like Benny Wells.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-19_212930.png"></p>
<p>But then, when I knew who I was facing, I really wanted to switch for Benny Wells.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-19_213028.png"></p>
<p><em>Your partner would be Finley, Greg.</em></p>
<p>Finley was the only one in my weight group. And apparently he really paid attention when Mr. Underwood showed the moves. Because he wrecked me from every single side. For the whole hour, I REALLY got to know Finley.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-19_213228.png"></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday"><a href="#Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>All the wrestling classes really put our school upside-down. Now, the boys are wrestling in the classrooms, simply everywhere! But the first quarter of recess is the worst.</p>
<p>You can’t go two meters without seeing someone wrestling. I simply tried to avoid them. Because I swear to you, if it goes on like this, one of them will directly roll into the stinky cheese, and then everything with the cheese finger will continue.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_133020.png"></p>
<p>My other problem is that I have to wrestle with Finley every single day. But I thought of something this morning. When I enter a higher weight class, I don’t have to face Finley anymore.</p>
<p>So I stuffed my hoodie with every sock and shirt that I have, to try and get into a higher weight class.</p>
<p>But I was still too thin.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_133308.png"></p>
<p>That means, I had to really get heavier. At first I thought I would just drench myself with fast food, but then a much better idea came up.</p>
<p>I wanted MUSCLES, not fat.</p>
<p>I wasn’t really interested in getting fit, but all the wrestling business got me thinking about it.</p>
<p>If I exercise regularly now, maybe that’ll come in handy later on.</p>
<p>Because we’ll be playing football in PE in spring. And we are sorted into “shirts” and “naked-top” teams. And somehow, I ALWAYS lands in “naked-top”.</p>
<p>I think they do this just to see the unfit boys get embarassed about themselves.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_133807.png"></p>
<p>But if I could manage to grow muscles, things are definitely going to change in April.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_133858.png"></p>
<p><em>Greg Heffley, you’re playing in shirts.</em></p>
<p>Today I told mom and dad my plan after dinner. I said that I’ll be needing a few weights and equipments.</p>
<p>I showed them a magazine I bought, just to let them know how fit I wanted to go for.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_134058.png"></p>
<p>At first, mom didn’t say much about it, but dad found it great. I think he was just happy that my views have changed:</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_134155.png"></p>
<p><em>If you train, you’ll grow muscles!</em></p>
<p><em>Muscles are so awful!</em></p>
<p>but mom said, if I want to have barbells, I have to first prove that I can stand a full training program. She said I should do squats and push-ups for two weeks.</p>
<p>I tried to tell her that if you wanted to grow actual muscles, you have to use the high-tech equipments that gyms provided. But mom clearly didn’t want to know anything about that.</p>
<p>Dad said if I wanted a barbell, I should just wait until Christmas.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-22_134737.png"></p>
<p>But there’s still one-and-a-half months till Christmas, and if I face Finley again in PE, I’m gonna throw a fit.</p>
<p>Mom and dad are obviously no help at this point. So I’ll have to take matters into my own hands.</p>
<h3 id="Saturday"><a href="#Saturday" class="headerlink" title="Saturday"></a>Saturday</h3><p>I can’t wait to start with my body-building-program today. Even if mom didn’t want to buy the equipments, we could still somehow make it work.</p>
<p>so I looked in our fridge and emptied the two big buckets of milk and juice and filled them with sand. Then I taped them to a stick and there it is, my barbell!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-23_150622.png"></p>
<p>Then I got an ironing board and a few boxes and handcrafted a bench. And now, the program can start.</p>
<p>But I needed a training partner, so I called Rupert. But when he appeared in front of the door with this fully feminine sport suit, I immediately knew it was a grave mistake to call him over.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-23_151121.png"></p>
<p>I let Rupert try out the bench first, because I wanted to know if it could withstand the weight.</p>
<p>After about five minutes he wanted to quit, but I wasn’t gonna let that happen. And that’s when the training partner come in: to cheer one to their goal!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-23_151446.png"></p>
<p><em>Fifteen to go! Start!</em></p>
<p>I knew that Rupert wasn’t gonna take the whole thing as seriously as me, so I’m testing his endurance.</p>
<p>In the middle of his training session, I went and put on a fake mustache Rodrick used for his play.</p>
<p>And when Rupert was trying to lift upwards, I went into his view.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-23_152225.png"></p>
<p>Yup, Rupert TOTALLY lost his concentration. He couldn’t lift the barbell anymore. At first I wanted to help him, but then I realized it: If Rupert doesn’t take the training seriously, he’s not gonna reach the same level as me.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-24_094602.png"></p>
<p>Finally I freed him, after he tried, by biting the lids on the buckets and letting the sand out.</p>
<p>As Rupert finished, I was ready to go. But then he said that he’s not interested in training anymore and went home.</p>
<p>At the moment I thought it was nothing. You can’t have such high expectations on others than on yourself.</p>
<h3 id="Wednesday-1"><a href="#Wednesday-1" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>Today we had a test on geography, and I have to say, I’ve been waiting for it for a long time.</p>
<p>It was about the cities of the USA and I was sitting in the very back and happened to be (very conveniently) under a huge map, on which all the cities were written and exaggerated with a thick marker. Then I kenw it: it was pure happiness!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-24_095308.png"></p>
<p>But when the test was going, Patty Farrell in the first row suddenly started speaking.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-24_095433.png"></p>
<p><em>Teacher! Teacher!</em></p>
<p>And then she told Mr. Ira that he should cover the map before the test.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-24_095515.png"></p>
<p><em>Thanks for the tip, Patty!</em></p>
<p>And thanks to Patty I completely blew my exam. I’m definitely gonna get revenge on her some time!</p>
<h3 id="Thursday-2"><a href="#Thursday-2" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>Today, mom went into my room with a flyer in the hand. When I saw it, I IMMEDIATELY knew what was going on.</p>
<p>It was a notice that our school was going to put on a theater show in winter. Man, I should’ve thrown it away when I saw it on the kitchen table.</p>
<p>I BEGGED her not to let me participate. This school activity is almost always a musical, and the last thing I need is being forced sing alone in front of the whole school.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-24_100821.png"></p>
<p>But all my begging only deepened mom’s forcing me in.</p>
<p>Mom said that I’m only gonna be “versatile” if I try different things.</p>
<p>Dad came up to see what was happening. I said to him that mom was forcing me to join the activity, and if I still had to go to the rehearsal, I’m not gonna have extra time for the body building program.</p>
<p>I knew it: with that, dad was on my side. Mom and dad argued for a while, but dad usually is the loser in these conversations.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-24_101105.png"></p>
<p>So I’ll have to prepare for the performance tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="Friday"><a href="#Friday" class="headerlink" title="Friday"></a>Friday</h3><p>This year they opted for “The Wizard of Oz”. Many kids were already dressed up for the roles that they want to play. Because I still haven’t watched the movie, it sorta seemed like I landed in a madhouse.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-25_205723.png"></p>
<p>The music teacher, Mrs. Norton, wanted all of us to sing the national song in order to hear how we sound. I sang with other boys who were also forced here by their moms. I tried to be as quiet as possible, but she still picked me out of nowhere. Crap.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-25_205904.png"></p>
<p>I had absolutely no idea what a “sopran” is, but as long as the girls were giggling, it couldn’t be anything good.</p>
<p>The audition was horrible. At the end, it will be decided who will play Dorothy, who was obviously a main role.</p>
<p>And in the first place came no other than Patty Farrell!</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-25_210419.png"></p>
<p>I suddenly had the idea to play the witch, because the witch was against Dorothy in every single way possible in the play.</p>
<p>But then others told me that there was a good witch and a bad witch, and they were going to let me play the good one.</p>
<h3 id="Monday"><a href="#Monday" class="headerlink" title="Monday"></a>Monday</h3><p>I hoped that Mrs. Norton wouldn’t select me, but today she said that everyone who auditioned will get a role. Great.</p>
<p>Mrs. Norton showed us the film, so everybody could go through the story. I wanted to decide who I’m going to play, but it doesn’t matter that much. Because every character had to sing or dance in some way. But, when we were halfway through, I finally knew who I wanted to play: a tree, because, one, the trees don’t have to sing, and two, they can bomb Dorothy with apples.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-25_211208.png"></p>
<p>For me, it was a lifelong dream of mine to be allowed to bomb Patty Farrell with apples in front of an audience. When this was at an end, I’m gonna have to thank my mom for forcing me in.</p>
<p>After the film ended, I signed up to be a tree. But unfortunately, quite a few of the other boys were thinking about the exact same thing. I suppose there’s quite a bit who want to make Patty Farrell into a chicken of some sort.</p>
<h3 id="Wednesday-2"><a href="#Wednesday-2" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>Yeah, just like what mom said: “Go for what you wish.” I’m now auditioning for a tree, but I don’t know if it’s a great idea anymore. The tree costumes don’t have any arm holes, so that means nothing with the apple throwing.</p>
<p>I should be glad that I got a role in time. Because there were too many candidates and not enough roles, they started to create roles.</p>
<p>Phillip James originally wanted to be the tin man, but now he’s playing a bush.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-28_200543.png"></p>
<h3 id="Friday-1"><a href="#Friday-1" class="headerlink" title="Friday"></a>Friday</h3><p>Did I say anything about being glad that I had a role? Today I realized, I only have a few words in the whole thing. For example, this is what I’m going to say when Dorothy picks an apple from my branch:</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-28_200709.png"></p>
<p>In other words: I have to sit here for two hours a day, only to say a few boring words.</p>
<p>Now I’m starting to think that Phillip James got lucky with the bush. He found out how to smuggle video games in there. With that, time definitely passes quicker.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-28_201119.png"></p>
<p>So I tried to deliberately mess up, so Mrs. Norton could replace me. But when you only have a few words to work with, it’s really hard to do so.</p>

        <h3 id="Monday"><a href="#Monday" class="headerlink" title="Monday"></a>Monday</h3><p>It’s finally October, that means only thirty days before Halloween. I like Halloween best out of all holidays, even though mom says I’m too old for all the “Trick or Treat” thing.</p>
<p>My dad also loves Halloween, but he has a different reason. When other parents wait with a big pile of sweets at the door, my dad waits with a big bin full of stinky water. And whenever a teenager passes, he makes them all wet.</p>
<p>I’m not exactly sure if dad really understood the meaning of Halloween. But I really don’t want to leave him out of the fun.</p>
<p>Today, another spooky party is taking place in the Crossland Highschool - with a ghost train and everything. I could persuade my mom into letting me and Rupert go.</p>
<p>Rupert changed into his costume from last year. And he clearly didn’t catch me saying that he should wear normal clothes in the telephone.</p>
<p>I tried to not get disappointed by that. It was the first time I was allowed to the party, and I didn’t want to leave Rupert out. Rodrick told me all about it and I was hoping for the chance since three years ago.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_152516.png"></p>
<p><em>Good evvvveeening.</em></p>
<p>But mom suddenly wanted to get home as quickly as possible, so she just left us there. After we entered, there was a shock. There were vampires jumping all over the place, with no heads.</p>
<p>But the worst had to be the chainsaw man. There was a guy waiting with a hockey mask and had a REAL motor chainsaw in the hand. Rodrick said the thing was made out of rubber. But I didn’t want to take any risks.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_180517.png"></p>
<p>It looked like the chainsaw man was going to murder us. Then mom came to the rescue.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_180829.png"></p>
<p><em>That’s not nice!</em></p>
<p><em>Sorry, ma’am.</em></p>
<p>The man had to show my mom the exit and the party was sort of over. Mom’s appearence might’ve been a bit embarrassing, but I’m gonna let her pass this time.</p>
<h3 id="Saturday"><a href="#Saturday" class="headerlink" title="Saturday"></a>Saturday</h3><p>The Crossland-Party inspired me. They charge five bucks per person, and yet there was at least a 20-meter queue outside.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to build my own ghost train. Then I need Rupert, because mom didn’t want our first floor to turn into a whole spooky castle.</p>
<p>I’m sure Rupert’s dad wouldn’t be happy about this from the get-go, so we decided to build it in Rupert’s basement and simply not telling anything about it to his parents.</p>
<p>We needed the whole day to make an awesome plan. And finally it looked a little something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_181826.png"></p>
<p>I don’t really wanna admit it, but our designs are MUCH cooler than the Crossland one.</p>
<p>Then it was obvious that we had to make advertisements. So we grabbed some paper and started making flyers.</p>
<p>I think maybe we’ve overdone it a bit, but we also wanted enough people to come.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_182623.png"></p>
<p><em>GHOST TRAIN</em></p>
<p><em>With REAL sharks</em></p>
<p><em>50 cents each</em></p>
<p>After we hanged the posters up and went back into Rupert’s basement, it was already 14:30, and we haven’t even started with the actual ghost train.</p>
<p>So our plan had to shrink.</p>
<p>When it was three, we went up to look whether there were actually people. And, there was already a line with about twenty kids from around the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>I know we wrote 50 cents on the advertisement, but desperate situations called for desperate measures.</p>
<p>So I told them it actually costs 2 dollars to enter and the 50 cent was a mistake.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_183517.png"></p>
<p>The first person that paid the two dollars was Simon Snella. After he gave us the money, we lead him inside, and me and Rupert went into the screaming section.</p>
<p>It was essentially just a bed, with us on both sides.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_183902.png"></p>
<p>Maybe we underestimated the spookiness, because Simon could only shake under the bed for a long time. We thought we could get him out, but he just wouldn’t cooperate.</p>
<p>I thought about the money that was gonna be in our pockets, and it’s all nothing because this guy is blocking our bed, and then, I knew it, he had to go!</p>
<p>Rupert’s dad came into the basement. At first, I was happy to see him, because I thought he was going to help us get Simon out and get the cash flowing in.</p>
<p>But he definitely wasn’t in the mood to help us.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_185904.png"></p>
<p>Rupert’s father wanted to know what we were doing and why was Simon Snella under the bed.</p>
<p>We told him that the basement was turned into a ghost train and that Simon PAID for it. We only had time for the screaming section and the blood sea was made out of half a bottle of ketchup.</p>
<p>I wanted to show Rupert’s dad our plan, in order to persuade him that this was real business, but he just wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-16_190635.png"></p>
<p>And shortly it became clear: the ghost train business came to an abrupt end.</p>
<p>But good news: because Rupert’s dad didn’t believe us, we don’t have to give Simon his money back. So that means we earned two dollars today.</p>
<h3 id="Sunday"><a href="#Sunday" class="headerlink" title="Sunday"></a>Sunday</h3><p>Rupert was busted after the ghost train thing. He isn’t allowed to watch TV for a whole week AND I’m not allowed to visit him.</p>
<p>I find the second part totally unreasonable, because he could still visit me but I can’t. Then where am I supposed to play my video games?</p>
<p>Rupert said sorry today. So I wanted to do something good this evening. So I watched Rupert’s favorite show and broadcasted it through my telephone to him, so at least he could know what happened.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_095824.png"></p>
<p><em>Wow, look at the flamethrower!</em></p>
<p><em>Whatever, it’s not so important.</em></p>
<p>I tried to describe what was going on as accurate as possible, but to be honest, I don’t think it really made any difference.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_100307.png"></p>
<p><em>It’s getting really funny.</em></p>
<p><em>Yeah! Hahahaha! That was really hilarious.</em></p>
<h3 id="Tuesday"><a href="#Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Rupert’s punishment is finally over, just in time for Halloween. I went to him  to check out his costume, and I have to say, I’m a bit jealous.</p>
<p>Rupert’s mom got a knight costume for him, and it is MUCH cooler than last year. </p>
<p>His costume has a helmet, a shield, a sword and EVERYTHING.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_101016.png"></p>
<p>I only have a second-hand costume. And: I’m still not sure about what I should be tomorrow night. Maybe I’ll figure something out last second. I think there’s nothing wrong with the toilet paper mummy again.</p>
<p>But tomorrow it will rain, so maybe that’s not so good an idea.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_101524.png"></p>
<p>On the last year, some adults in the neighbourhood got sour because of my costume, and I think it really affected the amount of sweets I got.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_101844.png"></p>
<p><em>What are YOU supposed to be?</em></p>
<p><em>A cowboy.</em></p>
<p>But I really don’t have enough time to get a proper costume, because, I’m doing soemthing much more important: planning the best route for us.</p>
<p>This year, I have a plan taht can definitely get us twice the candies last year.</p>
<h3 id="Halloween"><a href="#Halloween" class="headerlink" title="Halloween"></a>Halloween</h3><p>About an hour before we went out, I still had no costumes. Then, I promptly decided that I shall be a cowboy two times in a row.</p>
<p>Then mom knocked on my door and surprised me with a pirate costume. It has an eye patch, a hook and all the stuff.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_102458.png"></p>
<p>At half past six Rupert was standing in front of the door with his knight costume on, but he looked different from yesterday.</p>
<p>Rupert’s mom improved the safety of the costume, so that others can’t even recognize what he’s supposed to be from the outside.</p>
<p>She cut out a big hole on the helmet, so that he can see the outside better, and his whole costume was covered with light strips. Under the costume, he still had to wear his winterwear and instead of the sword, he was carrying a funny lantern in his hand.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_133829.png"></p>
<p>As usual, I took my pillow case and we wanted to go. But mom stopped us before I could get my foot out of the door.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_133936.png"></p>
<p><em>Take Manni with you!</em></p>
<p>Man, I kinda expected the whole thing to have a twist when she gave me the costume.</p>
<p>I told mom it was UNLIKELY for us to take Manni because we wanted to visit 152 houses in three hours. And we would reach the edge of the neighbourhood, and all this is too dangerous for a little boy.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t have said the last part, because before I was able to catch up on what was going on, mom said to dad that he should take care of us in case we go too far. Dad wanted to argue, but when mom said something, there’s no coming back.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_134310.png"></p>
<p>We didn’t even make it out of the yard when our neighbour Mr. Mitchell joined us with his son Jeremy.</p>
<p>Manni and Jeremy didn’t want to stop by any houses that smelled awful. That included practically every single house in our block.</p>
<p>Dad began to chat with Mr. Mitchell about football, and every time one of them wanted to say something important, they stopped walking.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_134600.png"></p>
<p>That means, we could only manage one house in twenty minutes.</p>
<p>After a few hours, dad and Mr. Mitchell went home with the little ones.</p>
<p>I was delighted, because Rupert and I could finally go. There was practically nothing in my pillow case, and I wanted to make use of as much time as possible.</p>
<p>Soon Rupert said he needed a pause. At first I thought he could stand through the three quarters. But when we reached my grandma, it became clear that he really needed a trip to the bathroom. So I said to him that if he returns in more than a minute, I’ll starting eating his sweets.</p>
<p>Then we moved on. But it was already ten thirty and that means Halloween is already over for most adults.</p>
<p>Then you shoudln’t be surprised when they open the door in their pajamas and looked annoyed.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_140138.png"></p>
<p>So we returned. After dad and Manni went away, we did quite good, and I was particularly satisfied with the amount of candies we got.</p>
<p>A group of teenagers on a truck suddenly appeared when we were halfway.</p>
<p>The guy on the loading part had an extinguisher in his hand and he splashed us with water.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_140655.png"></p>
<p>I have to say, Rupert did it quite nicely, because he blocked about 95% of the water with his shield. Or our sweets would be soaked.</p>
<p>When the truck went along, I shouted something to them. I didn’t know that I would regret it two seconds later.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_140900.png"></p>
<p><em>We’re calling the bullies!</em></p>
<p>The driver made an emergency brake and turned. I and Rupert ran for our lives, but the guys were on our tails.</p>
<p>The only safe place I could think of right this moment was my grandma’s house. We might’ve used a few gardens on the way. Grandma was already in bed, but I know she hid a second key under the doormat.</p>
<p>When we got into the house, I looked through the window to check whether the guys followed us. And there they were. I tried to talk them into leaving, but they just wouldn’t loosen up.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_172306.png"></p>
<p><em>Now we have SHELTER, and you can’t get us anymore.</em></p>
<p>A few moments later, it was clear that they were going to wait for us. So we decided to spend the night here. And we also decided to be cocky: we were going to act as monkeys.</p>
<p>At least I made monkey noises. But Rupert sounded more like an owl, but it’s fine.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_172532.png"></p>
<p>Then I called mom to inform her that we were going to spend the night at my grandma’s. But she sounded sour.</p>
<p>She said, tomorrow we still have to go to school, and we should go back home. I had to stand through a whole outbreak there.</p>
<p>When I looked out of the window again, the vehicle disappeared. But I know, those dudes hid somewhere to spy on us.</p>
<p>We sneaked from the back door outside, jumped across grandma’s garden fences and ran the whole way to the main road. I thought we had a better chance there, because there were no traffic lighting whatsoever.</p>
<p>The dark road is already spooky enough without a truck full of dudes. Every time a car came, we hid in the bushes. Because of this, it took us thirty minutes to finish 100 meters.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_173403.png"></p>
<p>You’re probably not gonna believe it, but we made it back home, without being discovered. When we reached our destination, we let out a deep breath.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_173540.png"></p>
<p>Then suddenly there was a scary scream and we saw water coming for us.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_174722.png"></p>
<p>Man, I TOTALLY forgot about dad.</p>
<p><img src="/../../images/doawk/2024-03-17_174752.png"></p>
<p>When I and Rupert got into the house, we put all the sweets out on the kitchen table.</p>
<p>The only ones worthed saving were a few mint bonbons (that were wrapped in foil) and the toothbrushes from Dr. Garrison.</p>
<p>I think, next Halloween I’ll just stay in and grab a few chocolate bars from the bowl that mom always puts on the fridge.</p>

        <h3 id="Tuesday"><a href="#Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>First, I want to make it clear: These are my memoirs and NOT a diary. I know, there’s something else on the cover, but when my mom volunteered to do it, I told her ESPECIALLY not to buy something that had the word “diary” on the cover.</p>
<p>Great then. When I face someone with this book in my hand, I’m definitely gonna receive a punch in the face.</p>
<p>And, there’s something else I also want to say: This idea came from my MOM, not me.</p>
<p>When she thought that I would write my so-called “feelings” in here, she’s definitely deceiving herself. Don’t expect to see things as “dear diary” this and “dear diary” that from me.</p>
<p>I’m doing all this only because when I’m rich and famous, I could do something better than answer boring questions. Then, my memoirs would come in handy.</p>
<p>As said, I’ll become rich and famous a few days later. But right now, I’m surrounded by idiots.</p>
<p>I want to say here, that junior high is the dumbest idea of all times. There, people throw kids like me, fresh out of primary school, with real gorillas, that have to shave two times a day.</p>
<p>And then they all wonder, why there are so many fights.</p>
<p>When you ask me, it’s certain that grades should be sorted depending on one’s height and not age. But then, boys like Mike Lerner will stay in the first grade.</p>
<p>Today’s the first day of school, and we’re all waiting for the teacher to distribute the sitting orders. I also thought I should doodle a bit in this book, so it doesn’t seem so boring.</p>
<p>Tip from me: on the first day of school, you really need to have an eye on where you sit. You just go into the classroom and throw your stuff forehandedly on the best desk and suddenly you hear the teacher say: “I hope you all like your seats, because it’ll stay the same for this year.”</p>
<p>I’m sitting here now, with Chris Meyers in front of me and Lionel James behind me.</p>
<p>Jason Brill came too late and quickly sat next to me, but I’m definitely not going to let that happen.</p>
<p><em>Is the seat free?</em></p>
<p><em>NO! NO!</em></p>
<p>In the next few hours, maybe I could sit between a few cute girls. But last year’s experience could prove that it’s not the best idea.</p>
<p><em>Could you give this to Sarah?</em></p>
<p><em>Of course, no problem!</em></p>
<p>Man, I really have NO IDEA what’s happening to the girls these days. Previously, in primary school, everything was so simple: When people had the quickest runner in their class, girls always screamed.</p>
<p>Ronnie McCoy in the fifth class was the quickest.</p>
<p>And now, everything’s a lot more complicated. Now, you have to wear the right pullover or have a lot of money or have a cute butt or something like that. And boys like Ronnie McCoy wonder, what’s happening?</p>
<p>The most well-known boy in my class is Bruce Anderson. What really stinks, especially because I’m ALWAYS interested in girls, is that boys like Bruce only gotten into it for a few years.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure I know how Bruce was in primary school.</p>
<p><em>Girls suck!</em></p>
<p><em>That’s true!</em></p>
<p>But do you think anyone will give me credit for that? Joke.</p>
<p>Just like I’ve said, Bruce is the most popular in our class. And that means, we other boys can only fight for the lower places.</p>
<p>According to my calculations, I’m 52nd or 53rd on the popularity chart this year. Good news: I’ll go up a place soon, because Charlie Davies directly one place above me is getting his braces next week.</p>
<p>I’m always trying to tell my friend Rupert about all this high-school-popularity-competition thing, but he simply doesn’t want to listen. I think he’s 150th or something on it.</p>
<h3 id="Wednesday"><a href="#Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>Today, we had a PE class. First things first, I sneaked to the basketball field to check whether the stinky cheese is still there. Yup.</p>
<p>The stinky cheese stayed there from last spring. It fell from someone’s packed lunch. After a few days, it’s become all slimey and rotten. And nobody wanted to play basketball there anymore, even though it was the only hoop with a net.</p>
<p>For a few days, a boy called Dennis Walsh would poke the cheese with his finger. And then, the things with the cheese finger started. The cheese finger was like a leprocy. The only way to get rid of it is to pass it on to someone else.</p>
<p>Pressing your thumb is the only way against it. But it’s not easy to press your thumb all the time. Finally, I wrapped mine with plastic wrap, so that it can stay pressed. But then I scored a four on appearance, but it’s worth it.</p>
<p>In April, a boy called Alf Hall got the cheese finger and the rest of the grade stayed as far as possible from him. In summer, Alf moved to California and took the cheese finger with him.</p>
<p>I hope no one will come back with the cheese finger. I definitely can’t handel that much stress.</p>
<h3 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>It’s really hard to me to accept the fact that the summer vacation is over and I have to actually get up early every morning to go to school.</p>
<p>Thanks to my older brother Rodrick, my summer vacation didn’t start all sunshine and rainbow. On the third or fourth day of the holiday, he woke me up in the middle of the night and told me I had slept through the whole vacation. Luckily I woke up in time for school.</p>
<p>Now, you probably think I’m stupid to have fallen for the trick. But Rodrick put on all his school things and set my clock, so it looked like it was seven in the morning. And he also shut my curtains close, so that I couldn’t see it was totally dark outside.</p>
<p>After Rodrick woke me up, I also dressed up and went down for breakfast, just like any other school days.</p>
<p>Then I made a loud noise. And then all of a sudden, my dad was standing in the kitchen, and shouting at me because I had to eat cornflakes at 3 in the morning.</p>
<p>I kinda lost myself for a second there.</p>
<p>Then I explained to dad, that Rodrick played a joke on me and that he should punish HIM.</p>
<p>Then dad marched to the basement to punish Rodrick. I’m behind. I didn’t wanna miss out on the show.</p>
<p>But Rodrick made it look like everything was normal and that he wasn’t doing anything weird. I believe, my dad still thinks I have a loose screw in my head somewhere.</p>
<h3 id="Friday"><a href="#Friday" class="headerlink" title="Friday"></a>Friday</h3><p>Today, we’re getting sorted into different reading groups.</p>
<p>You can’t tell at first sight, whether one is in the talented group or the dumb group. But when you see the title of the books which were distributed, it’s suddenly all clear.</p>
<p>I was really surprised when I found out I was in the talented group, because that means more homework.</p>
<p>At the end of the last semester, when the reading conference started, I did everything I could to get into the dumb group this year.</p>
<p>Mom is a good friend of our director. She somehow took the matter into her own hands and then, I was in the talented group again.</p>
<p>Mom always says that I’m a clever boy, but I’m just not “engaged” enough.</p>
<p>But if I learned something from Rodrick, it’s to make other’s expectation of you as low as possible. Then, they’ll be totally surprised when you actually do something.</p>
<p><em>Rodrick, when I return this evening, don’t leave your underpants on the dining table.</em></p>
<p><em>Later</em></p>
<p><em>Great!</em></p>
<p>To be honest, I’m really glad that my plan to get into the dumb group didn’t work.</p>
<h3 id="Saturday"><a href="#Saturday" class="headerlink" title="Saturday"></a>Saturday</h3><p>Sheesh, the first week of school is finally over, so I slept in today.</p>
<p>Most kids wake up early on Saturday to watch the TV or something like that, but I’m different. The only reason that I even get up on weekends is simply because the smell of my mouth is unbearable.</p>
<p>But, unfortunately, my dad wakes up at 6 in the morning every day, REGARDLESS of whether it’s a weekday or weekend, and he doesn’t understand why I want to spend my weekend like any normal person would.</p>
<p>I didn’thave any plans today, so I visited Rupert.</p>
<p>Rupert is THEORETICALLY my best friend, but that can change real quick.</p>
<p>I’ve been avoiding him from the start of the semester, because he did something really awkward.</p>
<p>We wanted to pick up our things from our lockers after the last session, there came Rupert to me and said:</p>
<p><em>Do you want to go play with me?</em></p>
<p>I’ve told Rupert for about a million times, that we’re not in primary school anymore, and we’re supposed to say “hang out” and not “play”. But no matter how many times I explain, he just doesn’t listen.</p>
<p>Since I’ve entered junior high, I’ve been paying more attention to my personal image. But Rupert is a real pain in the back.</p>
<p>I’ve known him for a few years, since he moved over.</p>
<p>His mom bought him a book: “How can you find friends in a new neighborhood”. And boy did he try it.</p>
<p><em>Knock, knock!</em></p>
<p><em>Hello?</em></p>
<p><em>Smudo!</em></p>
<p><em>Pardon?</em></p>
<p><em>Trying to make you laugh!</em></p>
<p><em>What?</em></p>
<p>I felt sorry for him, so I took him under my wings.</p>
<p>It’s really great to have him as a friend. Especially because I can play tricks on him that Rodrick did to ME.</p>
<p><em>When your hand is bigger than your face, you’re a genius.</em></p>
<p><em>REALLY?</em></p>
<p><em>Ha! Tricked! (smashing Rupert in the face)</em></p>
<p><em>But I’m a genius now, right?</em></p>
<p><em>Umm…we’ll see about that.</em></p>
<h3 id="Monday"><a href="#Monday" class="headerlink" title="Monday"></a>Monday</h3><p>I said that I can play all sorts of tricks on Rupert. I also have a little brother called Manni, on whom I could do NOTHING of the kind.</p>
<p>Mom and dad all protect Manni, like he’s a prince or something. And he just doesn’t get blamed when he actually deserved it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Manni drew a portrait with Edding on the door of my room. I thought, he’s finally going to get punishments (which he deserved) from mom and dad. But that didn’t happen.</p>
<p>But what really annoyed me is the nickname he had for me. When he was a baby, he just couldn’t pronounce the word “brother”. So he started to address me as “bubi”. And this thing WENT ON TILL NOW, even if I said to mom and dad that it should be forbidden.</p>
<p>Thank goodness none of my friends really noticed it, but it has been close for a couple of times.</p>
<p><em>It says “for bubi”!</em></p>
<p><em>Must be for someone else.</em></p>
<p>I have to help Manni get ready for kindergarten every single morning. And when I made his cereal, he just sits on his little stool and puts the living room key in his pocket.</p>
<p>And then, when it’s time to go, he puts his bowl upside down on the stool.</p>
<p>Mom argues with me all the time because I don’t eat my breakfast properly. But when she sees someone smash their cornflakes on a chair, she definitely doesn’t have an appetite either.</p>
<h3 id="Tuesday-1"><a href="#Tuesday-1" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h3><p>Did you guys guess that I’m SUPER GOOD at video games? I think I can duel anyone in my class.</p>
<p>But my dad just can’t cherish my talent. He always annoys me with the “you should go outside and do something active” saying.</p>
<p>When my dad said the exact same thing at dinner, I really wanted to explain to him that you could also play football or basketball in video games - and better, because you don’t have to get all hot and sweaty.</p>
<p>But he didn’t catch that.</p>
<p>My dad’s not a stubborn person. But when it comes to health problems and lifestyle choices, we jsut have so many quarrels.</p>
<p><em>OUT!</em></p>
<p>I have a feeling that he’s gonna unplug my gaming stuff if he knows how. Thank goodness they made it parent-proof.</p>
<p>When my dad made me go outside to do some sport, I just go to Rupert’s and continue playing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are only boring toys.</p>
<p>Every time when I bring a video game to play with Rupert, his dad would search it in the internet. And when there’s only A LITTLE BIT of blood or something in there, we’re not allowed to play it.</p>
<p>I’m starting to get bored, just playing Formula 1 all the time with Rupert. He’s no match for a real gamer like me. If you want to beat Rupert, you have to give his car a totally stupid name.</p>
<p>And when you overtake him, he just can’t stop laughing.</p>
<p>Today, after I finished with Rupert, I went home. On the way, I made use of my neighbour’s sprinkler to make me look all sweaty and wet. And it worked: dad was so happy.</p>
<p>But the trick is quickly put off the table, because when mom saw me, I had to shower.</p>
<h3 id="Wednesday-1"><a href="#Wednesday-1" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>Dad left me out of the house again today.</p>
<p>I’m pretty nervous about going to Rupert’s to play video games every time. Between my house and Rupert’s lived a strange boy called Finley, who always stayed in front of his house. And you’ll come upon a few weird conversations.</p>
<p><em>Do you want to see my secret mole?</em></p>
<p><em>Umm…no, thanks.</em></p>
<p>I’ve done sport with Finley together. He has his own language. For example, when he wants to answer nature’s call, he says:</p>
<p><em>JUICE! JUUUUICE!</em></p>
<p>We kids know more or less about it, but the teachers don’t.</p>
<p><em>It’s ok, little one.</em></p>
<p>Today, I went to Rupert’s as usual, because my brother Rodrick and his band are rehearsing in our basement again.</p>
<p>Rodrick’s band is really NOISY, and I’m not staying in when they’re playing.</p>
<p>His band’s name is “Volle Windel”, but on their bus wrote “Folle Vindel”.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ll think they do it because it looks cooler. But I’m pretty sure, it’s only because Rodrick has no idea how to write the two words.</p>
<p>Dad didn’t approve of the fact that Rodrick formed a band, but mom was heads over heels.</p>
<p>She even bought Rodrick’s first drum set.</p>
<p>I think, mom did that because she wanted all of us to learn instruments and be like the cool music family you see on TV.</p>
<p>Dad hates heavy metal, and that’s exactly the genre Rodrick plays. I think, mom doesn’t care about what sort of music they play, because everything’s the same for her. For instance, Rodrick was playing one of his CDs today in the living room, mom entered and randomly started dancing.</p>
<p>Rodrick was clearly annoyed, so he went in town and came back in a quarter with a pair of headphones. Now he has it all to himself.</p>
<h3 id="Thursday-1"><a href="#Thursday-1" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>Yesterday, Rodrick bought another heavy metal CD for himself, with a warning for parents on it.</p>
<p>I’m still not allowed to listen to a CD with warning signs on it, because mom and dad don’t permit me purchase anything of the kind. Then I realized, I could only listen to it if I somehow smuggle it out of the house.</p>
<p>After Rodrick went out this morning, I rang Rupert and told him to bring his CD-player to school.</p>
<p>Then I went back to Rodrick’s room and stole the CD from his shelf.</p>
<p>We are obviously not allowed to bring any gadgets to school, so we had to wait for recess. After the ring went off, we ran to the back of the school and took out Rodrick’s CD.</p>
<p>But Rupert forgot to put batteries in his CD-player, so everything was over.</p>
<p>Then I thought of a great game: You put the headphones on and try to shake them off without using your hands. The quicker of us two would then win.</p>
<p>I created a record of 7.5 seconds. But I think, I might’ve ripped a few stuffings apart.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Mrs. Milner came around the corner out of nowhere and was very angry of our game. She took away the CD-player from me.</p>
<p>But I think she somehow misunderstood what we had done. She said something about rock being some “terrible stuff” and it would contaminate our brains.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell her that there were no batteries in the CD-player, but she didn’t want to be interrupted. So I simply waited until she was finished and said “yes, Mrs. Milner.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Milner wanted to send us running again, but then Rupert starting howling and sobbing all of a sudden, because he didn’t want his brain “contaminated”.</p>
<h3 id="Friday-1"><a href="#Friday-1" class="headerlink" title="Friday"></a>Friday</h3><p>Now, I really messed up.</p>
<p>Yesterday night, when everyone was in bed, I sneaked downstairs to listen to Rodrick’s CD on the stereo.</p>
<p>I put on Rodrick’s new headphones and set the volume to MAX. Then I pressed “Play”.</p>
<p>I’m gonna make it clear now: I really can understand why there was a warning on the CD.</p>
<p>But I only got 30 seconds into the song. Then I was caught red-handed.</p>
<p>I forgot to plug the headphones into the stereo. So the music came out from the LOUDSPEAKER, not from the headphones.</p>
<p>Dad rushed me to my room, closed the door and said:</p>
<p><em>We need to talk, friendly!</em></p>
<p>When dad said something about “friends”, it’s obvious he’s angry. The first time dad said something like that to me, I didn’t think he was being ironic. And boy did I fall into his trap quickly.</p>
<p>It didn’t happen to me ever again.</p>
<p>This evening, dad barked at me for about ten minutes. Then he thought it would be better to go to bed and not stand in my room with his pajamas on. He prohibited video games for two weeks. I was expecting something like that. I should be glad that it wasn’t anything more.</p>
<p>The good thing about dad is that he recovers from anger very quickly.</p>
<p>When you happen to stumble upon dad’s anger arc, he usually just throws something at you, whatever he’s holding at the moment.</p>
<p>Mom’s TOTALLY different from dad. When someone did something and annoyed mom, she’ll think about it a few days later and then decide the punishments.</p>
<p>So, when waiting, one will do absolutely everything they can to avoid the punishments as much as possible.</p>
<p><em>Mom, I cleaned the dining room for fun!</em></p>
<p><em>Aww, how sweet.</em></p>
<p>But then, after a few days, when one forgets about it themselves, it comes.</p>
<p><em>Is that fun?</em></p>
<p><em>YEAH!</em></p>
<p><em>Then no video games for one week.</em></p>
<h3 id="Monday-1"><a href="#Monday-1" class="headerlink" title="Monday"></a>Monday</h3><p>This prohibit of video games got me better than I thought. But at least I’m not the only one in the family with anger.</p>
<p>Rodrick’s now angry towards mom. Manni played with one of his heavy metal posters and there was a woman in a bikini sitting on the bonnet of a car. Manni brought the picture to school, so that he could tell everyone about the things on it.</p>
<p>Upon receiving a call regarding this matter, mom wasn’t happy.</p>
<p>I saw the picture and thought there wasn’t anything inappropriate on it. But mom just didn’t want anything like that in the house.</p>
<p>Rodrick had to answer questions mom wrote down as a punishment.</p>
<p><em>Did this poster make you a better person?</em></p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p><em>Did it make you famous in your friends?</em></p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p><em>What do you want to say for having such a poster?</em></p>
<p><em>I’m ashamed of myself.</em></p>
<p><em>Do you have anything to say to women after owning such a dirty poster?</em></p>
<p><em>I’m sorry.</em></p>
<h3 id="Wednesday-2"><a href="#Wednesday-2" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h3><p>After video games got banned from me, Manni was allowed to use my equipments. Mom bought him a pile of educational games. Seeing him with them is pure torture for me.</p>
<p><em>What comes after two and rhymes with free?</em></p>
<p><em>Hmm…</em></p>
<p><em>Three! Three!</em></p>
<p>Good news: I finally found out how to smuggle my games into Rupert’s house: I’ll simply put them in Manni’s game’s boxes. It works like a charm.</p>
<h3 id="Thursday-2"><a href="#Thursday-2" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h3><p>Today, they started the election for our school speaker. I’m not interested in that sort of thing. But the more I think about it, the more I think I could make things different.</p>
<p>But nobody wanted the treasurer, they all want to be the big posts like the school speakers. When I promtoe myself as the treasurer tomorrow, it’s gonna be so good!</p>
<h3 id="Friday-2"><a href="#Friday-2" class="headerlink" title="Friday"></a>Friday</h3><p>Today, I signed up to be a candidate of the treasurer. Unfortunately, there was another boy called Marty Porter, a real math head. Maybe it’s not so easy anymore.</p>
<p>I told my dad I was gonna run for a position in school, and he seemed really excited about it. He also ran for something when he was my age and got the position.</p>
<p>After he went through every box in the basement, he found a flyer from the election.</p>
<p>I found the idea of making a poster good and anted dad to take me to the market on Sunday, so I could buy some cardboard and crayons. The whole night, I was thinking about the designs on my poster.</p>
<h3 id="Monday-2"><a href="#Monday-2" class="headerlink" title="Monday"></a>Monday</h3><p>Today, I brought my poster with me to school. I have to say, I find them really successful.</p>
<p>So, I started to put them up all around school. But it only took three minutes for the representative director Mr. Roy to find them.</p>
<p>Mr. Roy said that we’re not allowed to say anything “untrue” about the other candidates. I explained that Marty Porter DID have fleas in his hair and the school is going to shut down because of it.</p>
<p>But he took down my poster anyways. And Marty Porter was distributing lollipops the whole day to gain votes, when my posters were in Mr. Roy’s litter bin. And with that ended my life as a politician.</p>

<p>Bei Tagesanbruch regnen sie vom Himmel. Sie wehen über die Befestigungsmauern, fliegen radschlagend über die Dächer und flattern in die Schluchten zwischen den Häusern. Ganze Straßen sind von ihren Wirbeln erfüllt, weiß blitzen sie auf dem Pflaster. <em>Dringende Mitteilung an die Bewohner dieser Stadt</em>, steht auf ihnen. <em>Begeben Sie sich sofort aus offene Land</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By dawn, they were raining from the sky. They glided across the fortification wall, twirled over the roofs and fluttered in the gaps between the houses. The whole street was filled with them, they painted the cobble road white. <em>An urgent message to the citizens of this city</em>, On it said. <em>Please leave any open land at once</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Die Flut steigt. Klein, geld und bucklig hängt der Mond am Himmel. Auf den Dächern des strandhotels im Osten und in den Gärten dahinter lädt ein halbes Dutzend amerikanischer Artillerie-Einheiten ihre Mörser mit Brandgranaten.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tide rose. The moon, small, golden, hanged in the sky. Over the roofs of the beach hotel in the east and in the garden behind it, half a dozen American units were loading their planes with grenades and mortars.</p>
<h3 id="Bombs"><a href="#Bombs" class="headerlink" title="Bombs"></a>Bombs</h3><blockquote>
<p>Sie überqueren den Kanal um Mitternacht. Es sind zwölf, und sie sind nach Liedern benannt: <em>Stardust</em> und <em>Stormy Weather</em>, <em>In the Mood</em> und <em>Pistol-Packin’ Mama</em>. Das Meer gleitet tief unter ihnen her, übersät mit zahllosen weißen, zackigen Schaumkronen. Bald schon können die Navigatoren die flachen, mondbeschienenen Umrisse von Inseln ausmachen. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They crossed the canal at midnight. It was twelve, and they started naming songs: <em>Stardust</em> and <em>Stormy Weather</em>, <em>In the Mood</em> and <em>Pistol-Packin’ Mama</em>. The sea was getting deeper under them, with bits of white crests floating. Soon could the navigators draw out the flat, moon-lit outlines of different islands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frankreich.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>France.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Funkgeräte knister. Bedächtig, fast gemächlich verlieren die Bomber an Höhe. Rote Lichtstrahlen steigen von den Flugabwehrstellungen entlang der Küste auf. Dunkle Schiffswracks tauchen auf, versenkt oder zerschossen, eines mit abgetrenntem Bug, ein zweites brennt flackernd. Auf einer weit der Küste vorgelaterten Insel rennen verschreckte Schafe zwischen Felsen umher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Radios were rustling. The bombers drop slowly, almost gently from above. Red lights ascent from the antiaircrafts along the coast. Dark shipwrecks suddenly appeared, sank or destroyed, a few with separate pieces, another flickering with fire. On another side of the coast, scared sheep were running between rocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In jedem Flugzeug sitzt ein Bombemschütze, sieht durchs Zielfenster und zählt bis zwanzig. Vier, fünf, sechs, sieben. Für die Schützen sieht die näher kommende, ummauerte Stadt auf ihrer granitenen Landzunge wie ein fürchterlicher Zahn aus, schwarz und gefährlich, ein letzter Abszess, der weggeschnitten werden muss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In every aircraft sat a bombardier, who looks through the scope and counts to twenty. Four, five, six, seven. For the bombardiers, the approaching and unguarded city on their granite headland looked like a scary tooth, black and dangerous, a last abscess, that had to be cut.</p>
<h3 id="The-Girl"><a href="#The-Girl" class="headerlink" title="The Girl"></a>The Girl</h3><blockquote>
<p>In Ecke der Stadt, in dem hohen, schmalen Haus mit der Nummer 4 in der Rue Vauborel, kniet die blinde sechzehnjährige Marie-Laure LeBlanc im fünften und obersten Stock über einem niedrigen Tsich, der ganz von einem Modell bedeckt ist. Es ist eine Miniaturasgabe der Stadt, in der sie kniet, mit maßstabsgetreuen Nachbildungen der Häuser, Läden und Hotels innerhalb der Stadtmauern. Hier ist die Kathedrale mit dem durchbrochenen Turm, dort das wuchtige alte Château von Saint-Malo, und rundum ranken sich die Reihen zum Meer gewandter Häuser mit ihren Schornsteinen. Ein schmaler hölzerner Steg ragt von der Plage du Môle ins Wasser, über dem Fischmarkt wölbt sich ein zartes, netzartiges Dach, und auf den kleinen öffentlichen Plätzen stehen winzige Bänke, kaum größer als Apfelkerne.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a corner of the city, in a tall, narrow how with the number 4 in Rue Vauborel, the blind, aged sixteen girl Marie-Laure LeBlanc kneeled on the fifth and highest floor next to a table that is occupied with a model. It’s a model of the city, with scaled replications of houses, shops and hotels inside the city wall. Here is the cathedral with the tower, there the massive, old chateau of Saint-Malo, and all around the model, she was counting the number of houses near the sea with their chimneys. A narrow, wooden bridge went from the Plage du Mole in the water, a delicate, net-like roof arched over the fish market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marie-Laure fährt mit den Fingerspitzen über die zentimeterbreite Brüstung oben auf der Mauer, die einem unregelmäßigen Stern um das Modell zeichnet. Sie findet die Öffnung auf der Mauer, wo die vier Böllerkanonen aufs Meer hinausdeuten. «Bastion de la Hollande», flüstert sie, und ihre Finger wandern eine kleine Treppe hinunter, zur anderen Seite. «Rue des Cordiers. Rue Jacques Cartier».</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marie-Laure went through the centimeter-wide railing above the wall with her fingers. She found the opening on the wall, where the four saluting guns were facing the sea. «Bastion de la Hollande», she whispered, and her finger wandered a stair down, to the other side. «Rue des Cordiers. Rue Jacques Cartier.»</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In einer Ecke des Zimmers stehen zwei verzinkte, bis an den Rand mit Wasser gefüllte Eimer. Fülle sie, wann immer du kannst, hat ihr Großonkel gesagt, und die Badewanne im dritten Stock auch. Wer weiß, wann das Wasser wieder versiegt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a corner of the room, there were two zinc-coated-filled-to-the-top water bottles. Fill them whenever you can, her grandfather had said that, and the bathtub on the third floor too. Nobody knows, when the water will run out again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ihre Finger wandern zurück yum Turm der Kathedrale. Nach Süden yum Tor von Dinan. Den ganyen Abend durchstreift sie das Modell und wartet auf ihren Großonkel Etienne, dem das Haus gehört. Gestern Nacht ist er weggegangen, als sie schlief, und noch nicht zurückgekommen. Und jetzt wird es wieder Nacht, der Zeiger hat das Zifferblatt ein weiteres Mal umkreist, in den Häusern ringsum ist es ruhig, und sie kann nicht schlafen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her fingers wandered back to the tower of the cathedral. Then going south, to the door of Dinan. She has been going through this model for the whole evening and waiting for her uncle Etienne, to whom the house belonged to. He went out yesterday evening, when she had been sleeping, and hasn’t returned home. And now, it’s dark again, the Americans distributed the flyers a second time, the houses around her all quiet, and she couldn’t sleep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sie hört die Bomber, als sie bis auf fünf Kilometer herangekommen sind. Ein lauter werdendes Summen. Das Rauschen in einer Muschel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She heard the bombs when she reached five kilometers. A loud buzz. It sounded like noise in a shell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Als sie das Schlafzimmer öffnet, wird der Flugzeuglärm lauter. Ansonsten ist die Nacht schrecklich still: keine Motoren, keine Stimmen, kein Geklapper. Keine Sirenen, keine Schritte auf dem Pflaster. Nicht mal Möwen sind zu hören. Nur die Flut, die einen Block weiter und fünf Stockwerke tiefer gegen den Fuß der Stadtmauer schlägt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When she opened the bedroom door, the noise from the aircrafts got louder. But the night was frighteningly still: no motors, no sound, no rattle. No sirens, even seagulls couldn’t be heard. Only the tide, which was a block away and five-floor deeper than the city wall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Und noch etwas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And something else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Da raschelt etwas. Leise und sehr nahe. Sie öffnet den linken Fensterladen und fährt mit der Hand hinaus über die Latten des rechten. Da steckt ein Blatt Papier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something rattled. Quiet and very close. She opened the window on the left and went outside with her hand over the bars on the right. A piece of paper was there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sie hält es sich an die Nase. Es riecht nach frischer Tinte. Vielleicht auch Benzin. Das Papier ist trocken, es hat nicht lange dort gesteckt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She held it close to her nose. It gave off fresh tints. Maybe also petrol. The paper was dry, it hasn’t stayed there for too long.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marie-Laure steht zögernd am Fenster, im Strümpfen, das Zimmer im Rücken. Muscheln und Schneckenhäuser sind auf dem Schrank aufgereiht, Steine entlang der Fußleiste. Ihr Stock steht in der Ecke, der große Roman in Blindenschrift liegt umgedreht auf dem Bett. Das Dröhnen der Flugzeuge wird lauter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marie-Laure stands hesitantly at the window, in stockings, in the room back. Shells and snail shells are lined up on the cupboard, stones along the baseboard. Her stick is in the corner, the big novel in Braille lies upside down on the bed. The roar of the planes becomes louder.</p>
<h3 id="The-Boy"><a href="#The-Boy" class="headerlink" title="The Boy"></a>The Boy</h3><blockquote>
<p>Fünf Straßen weiter nördlich wird der achtzehnjährige, weißhaarige deutsche Gefreite Werner Hausner von einem schwachen, abgehackten Brummen geweckt. Kaum mehr als ein Summen. Fliegen an einer weit entfernen Fensterscheibe.<br>Wo ist er? Der süße, leicht chemische geruch von Gewehröl hängt in der Luft, der Holzgeruch frisch gezimmerter Granatenkisten, das Mottenkugelaroma alter Bettwäsche - er ist in einem Hotel. Den Hôtel des Abeilles, dem Hotel der Bienen.<br>Es ist immer noch nacht. Immer noch früh.<br>Vom Meer her erklingen Pfiffe und Explosionen. Flak-Feuer.<br>Der Feldwebel des Luftabwehrkommandos läuft über den Korridor zur Treppe. «Runter in den Keller», ruft er über die Schulter. Werner schaltet seine Lampe ein, rollt die Decke in sein Bündel und macht sich auf den Weg.<br>Vor noch gar nicht so langer Zeit war das Hôtel des Abeilles ein fröhlicher Ort, hellblaue Fensterläden schmücken die Fassade, im Cafe gab es Austern polierten Gläsern. Das Hotel hatte einundzwanzig Gästezimmer, alle mit Seeblick, und der Kamin in der Halle war groß wie ein Lastwagen. Wochenendausflügler aus Paris nahmen hier einen Aperitif, vor ihnen waren es gelegentlich Abgesandte der Republik gewesen, Minister und Vizeminister, Äbte und Admiräle, und in den Jahrhunderten davor windgegerbte Korsaren: Mörder, Plünderer, Piraten, Seefahrer.<br>Noch früher, bevor es zu einem Hotel wurde, vor gut fünfhundert Jahren, war es das Heim eines wohlhabenden Privatiers gewesen, der das Schiffekapern aufgegeben hatte, um die Bienen auf den Weiden außerhalb von Saint-Malo zu studieren, seine Beobachtungen in Notizbüchern festzuhalten und den Honig direkt aus den Waben zu essen. In den aus Eichenholz geschnitzten Wappen über den Türstöcken sind immer noch Hummeln zu erkennen, und der mit Efeu überwucherte Brunnen im Hof hat die Form eines Bienenstocks. Am besten gefallen Werner fünf verblichene Fresken an den Decken der schönsten Räume oben, auf denen kindsgroße Bienen vor einem blauen Hintergrund schweben, große, faule Drohnen und Arbeiterinnen mit durchscheinenden Flügeln, und über einer achteckigen Badewanne windet sich eine einzelne, fast drei Meter langen Königin über die Decke. Sie hat zahllose Augen und einen pelzigen Leib.</p>
