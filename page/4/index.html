        <h3 id="Flyers"><a href="#Flyers" class="headerlink" title="Flyers"></a>Flyers</h3><blockquote>
<p>Bei Tagesanbruch regnen sie vom Himmel. Sie wehen über die Befestigungsmauern, fliegen radschlagend über die Dächer und flattern in die Schluchten zwischen den Häusern. Ganze Straßen sind von ihren Wirbeln erfüllt, weiß blitzen sie auf dem Pflaster. <em>Dringende Mitteilung an die Bewohner dieser Stadt</em>, steht auf ihnen. <em>Begeben Sie sich sofort aus offene Land</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By dawn, they were raining from the sky. They glided across the fortification wall, twirled over the roofs and fluttered in the gaps between the houses. The whole street was filled with them, they painted the cobble road white. <em>An urgent message to the citizens of this city</em>, On it said. <em>Please leave any open land at once</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Die Flut steigt. Klein, geld und bucklig hängt der Mond am Himmel. Auf den Dächern des strandhotels im Osten und in den Gärten dahinter lädt ein halbes Dutzend amerikanischer Artillerie-Einheiten ihre Mörser mit Brandgranaten.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tide rose. The moon, small, golden, hanged in the sky. Over the roofs of the beach hotel in the east and in the garden behind it, half a dozen American units were loading their planes with grenades and mortars.</p>
<h3 id="Bombs"><a href="#Bombs" class="headerlink" title="Bombs"></a>Bombs</h3><blockquote>
<p>Sie überqueren den Kanal um Mitternacht. Es sind zwölf, und sie sind nach Liedern benannt: <em>Stardust</em> und <em>Stormy Weather</em>, <em>In the Mood</em> und <em>Pistol-Packin’ Mama</em>. Das Meer gleitet tief unter ihnen her, übersät mit zahllosen weißen, zackigen Schaumkronen. Bald schon können die Navigatoren die flachen, mondbeschienenen Umrisse von Inseln ausmachen. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They crossed the canal at midnight. It was twelve, and they started naming songs: <em>Stardust</em> and <em>Stormy Weather</em>, <em>In the Mood</em> and <em>Pistol-Packin’ Mama</em>. The sea was getting deeper under them, with bits of white crests floating. Soon could the navigators draw out the flat, moon-lit outlines of different islands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frankreich.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>France.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Funkgeräte knister. Bedächtig, fast gemächlich verlieren die Bomber an Höhe. Rote Lichtstrahlen steigen von den Flugabwehrstellungen entlang der Küste auf. Dunkle Schiffswracks tauchen auf, versenkt oder zerschossen, eines mit abgetrenntem Bug, ein zweites brennt flackernd. Auf einer weit der Küste vorgelaterten Insel rennen verschreckte Schafe zwischen Felsen umher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Radios were rustling. The bombers drop slowly, almost gently from above. Red lights ascent from the antiaircrafts along the coast. Dark shipwrecks suddenly appeared, sank or destroyed, a few with separate pieces, another flickering with fire. On another side of the coast, scared sheep were running between rocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In jedem Flugzeug sitzt ein Bombemschütze, sieht durchs Zielfenster und zählt bis zwanzig. Vier, fünf, sechs, sieben. Für die Schützen sieht die näher kommende, ummauerte Stadt auf ihrer granitenen Landzunge wie ein fürchterlicher Zahn aus, schwarz und gefährlich, ein letzter Abszess, der weggeschnitten werden muss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In every aircraft sat a bombardier, who looks through the scope and counts to twenty. Four, five, six, seven. For the bombardiers, the approaching and unguarded city on their granite headland looked like a scary tooth, black and dangerous, a last abscess, that had to be cut.</p>
<h3 id="The-Girl"><a href="#The-Girl" class="headerlink" title="The Girl"></a>The Girl</h3><blockquote>
<p>In Ecke der Stadt, in dem hohen, schmalen Haus mit der Nummer 4 in der Rue Vauborel, kniet die blinde sechzehnjährige Marie-Laure LeBlanc im fünften und obersten Stock über einem niedrigen Tsich, der ganz von einem Modell bedeckt ist. Es ist eine Miniaturasgabe der Stadt, in der sie kniet, mit maßstabsgetreuen Nachbildungen der Häuser, Läden und Hotels innerhalb der Stadtmauern. Hier ist die Kathedrale mit dem durchbrochenen Turm, dort das wuchtige alte Château von Saint-Malo, und rundum ranken sich die Reihen zum Meer gewandter Häuser mit ihren Schornsteinen. Ein schmaler hölzerner Steg ragt von der Plage du Môle ins Wasser, über dem Fischmarkt wölbt sich ein zartes, netzartiges Dach, und auf den kleinen öffentlichen Plätzen stehen winzige Bänke, kaum größer als Apfelkerne.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a corner of the city, in a tall, narrow how with the number 4 in Rue Vauborel, the blind, aged sixteen girl Marie-Laure LeBlanc kneeled on the fifth and highest floor next to a table that is occupied with a model. It’s a model of the city, with scaled replications of houses, shops and hotels inside the city wall. Here is the cathedral with the tower, there the massive, old chateau of Saint-Malo, and all around the model, she was counting the number of houses near the sea with their chimneys. A narrow, wooden bridge went from the Plage du Mole in the water, a delicate, net-like roof arched over the fish market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marie-Laure fährt mit den Fingerspitzen über die zentimeterbreite Brüstung oben auf der Mauer, die einem unregelmäßigen Stern um das Modell zeichnet. Sie findet die Öffnung auf der Mauer, wo die vier Böllerkanonen aufs Meer hinausdeuten. «Bastion de la Hollande», flüstert sie, und ihre Finger wandern eine kleine Treppe hinunter, zur anderen Seite. «Rue des Cordiers. Rue Jacques Cartier».</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marie-Laure went through the centimeter-wide railing above the wall with her fingers. She found the opening on the wall, where the four saluting guns were facing the sea. «Bastion de la Hollande», she whispered, and her finger wandered a stair down, to the other side. «Rue des Cordiers. Rue Jacques Cartier.»</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In einer Ecke des Zimmers stehen zwei verzinkte, bis an den Rand mit Wasser gefüllte Eimer. Fülle sie, wann immer du kannst, hat ihr Großonkel gesagt, und die Badewanne im dritten Stock auch. Wer weiß, wann das Wasser wieder versiegt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a corner of the room, there were two zinc-coated-filled-to-the-top water bottles. Fill them whenever you can, her grandfather had said that, and the bathtub on the third floor too. Nobody knows, when the water will run out again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ihre Finger wandern zurück yum Turm der Kathedrale. Nach Süden yum Tor von Dinan. Den ganyen Abend durchstreift sie das Modell und wartet auf ihren Großonkel Etienne, dem das Haus gehört. Gestern Nacht ist er weggegangen, als sie schlief, und noch nicht zurückgekommen. Und jetzt wird es wieder Nacht, der Zeiger hat das Zifferblatt ein weiteres Mal umkreist, in den Häusern ringsum ist es ruhig, und sie kann nicht schlafen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her fingers wandered back to the tower of the cathedral. Then going south, to the door of Dinan. She has been going through this model for the whole evening and waiting for her uncle Etienne, to whom the house belonged to. He went out yesterday evening, when she had been sleeping, and hasn’t returned home. And now, it’s dark again, the Americans distributed the flyers a second time, the houses around her all quiet, and she couldn’t sleep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sie hört die Bomber, als sie bis auf fünf Kilometer herangekommen sind. Ein lauter werdendes Summen. Das Rauschen in einer Muschel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She heard the bombs when she reached five kilometers. A loud buzz. It sounded like noise in a shell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Als sie das Schlafzimmer öffnet, wird der Flugzeuglärm lauter. Ansonsten ist die Nacht schrecklich still: keine Motoren, keine Stimmen, kein Geklapper. Keine Sirenen, keine Schritte auf dem Pflaster. Nicht mal Möwen sind zu hören. Nur die Flut, die einen Block weiter und fünf Stockwerke tiefer gegen den Fuß der Stadtmauer schlägt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When she opened the bedroom door, the noise from the aircrafts got louder. But the night was frighteningly still: no motors, no sound, no rattle. No sirens, even seagulls couldn’t be heard. Only the tide, which was a block away and five-floor deeper than the city wall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Und noch etwas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And something else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Da raschelt etwas. Leise und sehr nahe. Sie öffnet den linken Fensterladen und fährt mit der Hand hinaus über die Latten des rechten. Da steckt ein Blatt Papier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something rattled. Quiet and very close. She opened the window on the left and went outside with her hand over the bars on the right. A piece of paper was there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sie hält es sich an die Nase. Es riecht nach frischer Tinte. Vielleicht auch Benzin. Das Papier ist trocken, es hat nicht lange dort gesteckt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She held it close to her nose. It gave off fresh tints. Maybe also petrol. The paper was dry, it hasn’t stayed there for too long.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marie-Laure steht zögernd am Fenster, im Strümpfen, das Zimmer im Rücken. Muscheln und Schneckenhäuser sind auf dem Schrank aufgereiht, Steine entlang der Fußleiste. Ihr Stock steht in der Ecke, der große Roman in Blindenschrift liegt umgedreht auf dem Bett. Das Dröhnen der Flugzeuge wird lauter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marie-Laure stands hesitantly at the window, in stockings, in the room back. Shells and snail shells are lined up on the cupboard, stones along the baseboard. Her stick is in the corner, the big novel in Braille lies upside down on the bed. The roar of the planes becomes louder.</p>
<h3 id="The-Boy"><a href="#The-Boy" class="headerlink" title="The Boy"></a>The Boy</h3><blockquote>
<p>Fünf Straßen weiter nördlich wird der achtzehnjährige, weißhaarige deutsche Gefreite Werner Hausner von einem schwachen, abgehackten Brummen geweckt. Kaum mehr als ein Summen. Fliegen an einer weit entfernen Fensterscheibe.<br>Wo ist er? Der süße, leicht chemische geruch von Gewehröl hängt in der Luft, der Holzgeruch frisch gezimmerter Granatenkisten, das Mottenkugelaroma alter Bettwäsche - er ist in einem Hotel. Den Hôtel des Abeilles, dem Hotel der Bienen.<br>Es ist immer noch nacht. Immer noch früh.<br>Vom Meer her erklingen Pfiffe und Explosionen. Flak-Feuer.<br>Der Feldwebel des Luftabwehrkommandos läuft über den Korridor zur Treppe. «Runter in den Keller», ruft er über die Schulter. Werner schaltet seine Lampe ein, rollt die Decke in sein Bündel und macht sich auf den Weg.<br>Vor noch gar nicht so langer Zeit war das Hôtel des Abeilles ein fröhlicher Ort, hellblaue Fensterläden schmücken die Fassade, im Cafe gab es Austern polierten Gläsern. Das Hotel hatte einundzwanzig Gästezimmer, alle mit Seeblick, und der Kamin in der Halle war groß wie ein Lastwagen. Wochenendausflügler aus Paris nahmen hier einen Aperitif, vor ihnen waren es gelegentlich Abgesandte der Republik gewesen, Minister und Vizeminister, Äbte und Admiräle, und in den Jahrhunderten davor windgegerbte Korsaren: Mörder, Plünderer, Piraten, Seefahrer.<br>Noch früher, bevor es zu einem Hotel wurde, vor gut fünfhundert Jahren, war es das Heim eines wohlhabenden Privatiers gewesen, der das Schiffekapern aufgegeben hatte, um die Bienen auf den Weiden außerhalb von Saint-Malo zu studieren, seine Beobachtungen in Notizbüchern festzuhalten und den Honig direkt aus den Waben zu essen. In den aus Eichenholz geschnitzten Wappen über den Türstöcken sind immer noch Hummeln zu erkennen, und der mit Efeu überwucherte Brunnen im Hof hat die Form eines Bienenstocks. Am besten gefallen Werner fünf verblichene Fresken an den Decken der schönsten Räume oben, auf denen kindsgroße Bienen vor einem blauen Hintergrund schweben, große, faule Drohnen und Arbeiterinnen mit durchscheinenden Flügeln, und über einer achteckigen Badewanne windet sich eine einzelne, fast drei Meter langen Königin über die Decke. Sie hat zahllose Augen und einen pelzigen Leib.</p>

        <p><em>Sophie and Hans went into the university with a suitcase full of flyers.</em></p>
<p>They have to do it quick. They only have twenty minutes. And then, the lectures will end and students will come out. Nobody can see them.</p>
<p>They put sheets on the stairs, on the bars. Slowly, they went up. They put flyers in front of every lecture room door. Many sheets. Then they shut the suitcase close and went down again. The students came out and took the sheets in their hands. They started reading…a few stuffed them in their pockets, others left them falling. “Stop!” Sophie and Hans heard a man shout. “Stand still, you two!” It’s the janitor. He grabbed Hans and Sophie by the arm. “The thing with the leaflets, it was you two! I saw you! Come!”</p>
<p>“Leaflets? Us? But no…” Hans still wanted to say something, but the man kept on shouting, “It was you! Come!”</p>
<p>They followed him to the rector’s office.</p>
<p>“Hail Hitler!” He shouted. “These students are the ones spreading the leaflets! I saw them!”</p>
<p>The rector came out of his office. “Hail Hitler! You did a good job! Please bring them to me.” They went into the office.</p>
<p>“You can go now. I’ll call you later.” The rector said. “Hail Hitler!” The door closed.</p>
<p>“Now to you.” The rector said to Sophie and Hans. “So? Do you have anything to say?”</p>
<p>“I know nothing!” Hans answered. “We just came out of professor Huber’s lecture, then the janitor came and shouted something about leaflets.”</p>
<p>“From the lecture, eh? And the suitcase there?”</p>
<p>“It’s empty.”</p>
<p>“So you two went for a walk with an empty suitcase?”</p>
<p>“We wanted to visited our mother, so we had to pack our clothes.”</p>
<p>“Ah, and the flyers?”</p>
<p>Then came a knock on the door.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>A uniformed young man came in. It’s the student leader.</p>
<p>“Hail Hitler!”</p>
<p>“It’s you. Good. These two have spread flyers against the German nation…”</p>
<p>“We didn’t!” Hans interrupted quickly.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna see.” Then, the rector said to the leader:</p>
<p>“Do you want to speak with these two? I have to make a call.”</p>
<p>Sophie and Hans told the same thing to the student leader.</p>
<p>He said: “Our janitor is very cautious. Right now, the voices aren’t so good, you know that.”</p>
<p>It’s absolutely unbelievable! He fell for it!</p>
<p>But two men were already in the room.</p>
<p>“Gestapo.” Hans and Sophie looked at each other. “We have to take you!”</p>
<p>The janitor stood at the exit: “Now we’ve caught you!” He said to them and again. “Hail Hitler!”</p>
<p>The Gestapos also trusted the two at first.</p>
<p>But a group of police have searched their apartment and saw everything.</p>
<p>Hans kept his work in his room.</p>
<p>They didn’t stand a chance anymore. They were brought into two different rooms. Different men questioned them. What could they have said? They told everything.</p>
<p>“You have been writing, copying and distributing flyers!”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Who helped you?”</p>
<p>“No one!”</p>
<p>“So you’re telling me, you did that all alone?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Both said the same thing. They didn’t want to give in and betray the others. But they couldn’t do anything about it. The police soon discovered their contact with Christoph Probst. Then they also discovered Alexander Schmorell and professor Huber. But Hans and Sophie didn’t know that.</p>
<p>Two days after the capture, they came into trial.</p>
<p>No normal trial. A show trial. The Nazis still have to show that they have power in this country. People in Munich have been speaking of the flyers and the White Rose too much. The Nazis wanted an example. The judge flew here from Berlin just for the occasion. Freisler. The name is well known across the country. Hans, Sophie and Christoph didn’t stand a chance against him. He laughed about them, shouted, but never really let them say anything. And in the hall, there were only Nazis sitting. Hans, Sophie and Christoph tried to stay quiet. But for Christoph is it especially hard. He has kids. When he’s gone, what should they do?</p>
<p>At the end of the trial, Freisler read the verdict against Hans Scholl, Sophie Scholl and Christoph Probst. “During the war, the accused have sabotaged the back with flyers. Our soldiers at the front were greatly influenced. Therefore, they will receive death penalty.”</p>
<p>At the back of the hall can a man’s shouting be heard: “Are there justice anymore?” It’s Sophie’s and Hans’ father. Others informed him of the trial at the last second and he came. Two policemen held him by the arm and went out.</p>
<p>After the reading of the verdict, Hans, Sophie and Christoph had to go into their cells.</p>
<p>What now? How do others wait for their death?</p>
<p>Sophie’s heart was beating. She had fear. Did she think that her life and death had a meaning? And that so many her age had to die? It’s war. She obviously thought of her parents. How should they live on, when their two children are dead?</p>
<p>Then, the door opened.</p>
<p>“Visit for you!” A police said.</p>
<p>Sophie went after her into the visit room.</p>
<p>It’s them!</p>
<p>Her mother, her father!</p>
<p>“Sophie!”</p>
<p>She smiled and gave them her hand across from the barrier.</p>
<p>Thank God! Mother isn’t crying! She is looking at her direct in the eye.</p>
<p>Sophie was happy.</p>
<p>They talked about their family, about the coming spring.</p>
<p>But they didn’t have enough time.</p>
<p>“Miss Scholl!” She already heard them calling.</p>
<p>Sophie held her mother’s hand once again.</p>
<p>“Sophie: Jesus!” She said.</p>
<p>“Yes, you too!” Sophie smiled.</p>
<p>Then she had to return to her cell.</p>
<p>“You still have two hours.” The poce said.</p>
<p>Two hours. The priest came. Sophie talked with him.</p>
<p>Then, the police came back.</p>
<p>Sophie followed behind her.</p>
<p>Everything is gray here. No window. Nothing of spring could be seen.</p>
<p>They went into a room.</p>
<p>Hans and Christoph were there!</p>
<p>Were they smiling? Sophie hugged both of them.</p>
<p>A police stood behind them.</p>
<p>He gave them a cigarette.</p>
<p>They smoked it together. Everyone took turns. Sophie, too.</p>
<p>All three smoked slowly together.</p>
<p>The last minute.</p>
<p>Then, the police called out: “Come!”</p>
<p>“Am I first?”</p>
<p>The police nodded.</p>
<p>Sophie smiled.</p>
<p>She went.</p>
<p>It was February 22nd, 1943, about 17 o’clock.</p>

        <p><em>Now, professor Huber is also in the group. It’s not always easy to talk with him.</em></p>
<p>He just believes: “The German army is good! They’re going to go against Hitler!”</p>
<p>The teenagers knew better. They had seen the troops shoot women and children.</p>
<p>They talked with the professor for a long time. In the end, they didn’t write anything about the army.</p>
<p>And Hans had new connections. With a group in Berlin.</p>
<p>“Who are these people? Communists?” The professor asked.</p>
<p>“I think there are also communists in there.” Hans answered.</p>
<p>The professor jumped. “Communists? Never!”</p>
<p>The professor didn’t want to know anything about that.</p>
<p>“Hitler should go and then Stalin comes? Don’t you know, what that means?”</p>
<p>Yes, they’ve heard about Stalin’s terror region. “But right now, that’s not the most important.” Hans thinks. “Everyone against Hitler should work together!”</p>
<p>“Not with communists! You all know, what that means!”</p>
<p>A few days later, they didn’t have to persuade each other anymore.</p>
<p>The Gestapo caught the group in Berlin. The “Red Capelle”, the Nazis called it that.</p>
<p>“Just like I said: Communists!” The professor said.</p>
<p>Every participant received death penalty.</p>
<p>“The end for everyone is the same.” Hans said.</p>
<p>Hans, Sophie, Alexander and Christoph: They all have fear.</p>
<p>But, they still went on with the next sheet.</p>
<p>“Whoever doesn’t hear, has to experience, we always say to the children. We also know, a smart child only puts their finger once on the stove…they learn.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks, Hitler’s soldiers fought on in Africa and Russia. Many think: Hitler, the Hitler, can finally end all of this. Others think: That can’t be it.</p>
<p>But now, the German troops aren’t progressing in Egypt. They’re also marching slowly, extremely slowly in the east, and many have fallen. Why?</p>
<p>Who caused the deaths? Hitler or Goebbels? They’re definitely not paying for that. But people are dying. Every day, thousands are falling in Russia. When the situation gets tough, grief enters German families. Nobody can dry the tears of many mothers. And Hitler still continues with his lies. In reality, it is exactly him who grabbed their sons and sent them to death.</p>
<p>Every word out of Hitler’s mouth is a lie. He said freedom but wanted war. And when he addresses God, he thinks of Satan. And we’ve learned: There are real demons, and it is below us.</p>
<p>Every time, there were people who stood against the evil: brave, free people.</p>
<p>And now, I’ll ask you, if you’re a Christian: Why aren’t you acting? What are you waiting for? Do you always think that someone else is going to do everything for you? We have to rise against the evil. And the evil is Hitler.</p>
<p>What we’ll do? Sabotage, in the factories, in the trains, in the schools, in Nazi meetings!</p>
<p>We’re going to act, we’re writing on. The White Rose isn’t going to stay quiet!”</p>
<p>Then, shock came.</p>
<p>The Germans got defeated in Stalingrad.</p>
<p>More than two hundred thousand German soldiers died. “A German soldier will never surrender!” Better, they die.</p>
<p>The Gestapo and the SS are especially nervous in the time.</p>
<p>Aren’t anyone hearing the words against Hitler?</p>
<p>And then these flyers from the White Rose! In Hamburg, in Saarbrücken, in Innsbruck! People found them all across the nation. Who wrote such a thing? An expert analyzed the text. It’s students that have written it, that’s clear. Not Communists, but Christian students. The center of all this seems to be in Munich, in the university. But it’s large. The Gestapo is on a search in Munich. But they haven’t found the White Rose.</p>
<p>Hans and Alexander also started to paint words in white on the walls at night. They are really happy, when they see it stay.</p>
<p>But isn’t that too dangerous?</p>
<p>“The Gestapos asked me about you.” A friend of Hans said to him.</p>
<p>But Hans continued on.</p>
<p>“Now, it can’t last that long!”</p>
<p>The group wrote the next sheet together.</p>
<p>“To every German!</p>
<p>The war is coming to an end soon. Hitler can’t strive on, he can only keep the war going.</p>
<p>What’s the German nation doing? It’s seeing nothing and hearing nothing. It’s going with its guider to hell. I’m fighting on till the last man, Hitler said that. And he’s already lost the war.</p>
<p>Germans! Do you want you and your children to die before Hitler just like the Jews? Do you want to stay as the hated nation of German? No! Then do something. Speak what you think out loud! Sabotage the production line! We have more people than Hitler. A new war is beginning. Come with us. There’s still time.”</p>

        <p><em>Sophie picked up Hans and Alexander from the train station.</em></p>
<p>“Sophie!” Are they happy? They looked sad.</p>
<p>“We’re meeting this evening.” Hans said, “We have to make the next flyer!”</p>
<p>“Today?” Sophie asked. “You’re obviously tired…”</p>
<p>At home, he told her sister about what he had seen. About the pale and sick Jews in ghettos, about the execution of Russian soldiers, the Romens, also women and children.</p>
<p>Hans cried. “On one street, there were Jews working. Street work. Something for men. A little girl was there, she’s about the same age as you. Next to her stood a fat German soldier with a rifle, he only shouts: ‘Quicker! Get to work!’ I wanted to give my chocolate to the girl. She didn’t take it. She looked at me and didn’t take my chocolate. She was like you, do you understand? But she had a yellow star on her and was terribly thin…For her, I was a nazi, a murderer!”</p>
<p>“She definitely understood…”</p>
<p>“What did she understand? I’m one of them! For the rest of the world, I’m a Nazi, a killer! Just because I’m German.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. We have to produce new leaflets. This evening.”</p>
<p>Two days later, the next flyer was ready.</p>
<p>“One can’t argue with the Nazis. It is wrong to speak of a National Socialist worldview. Because they lie, they have always lied from the beginning. Hitler wrote it himself in his book ‘Mein Kampf’(I’ve never read any German worse than this): ‘If one wants to govern a nation, one has to tell lies to the people.’ And he did exactly that. And the intellectuals? They say absolutely nothing!</p>
<p>We’re just in front of the end. It’s time. We have to go back on track and form a rebellion, only then, can Germany be free again, and this war will finally end. A end with terror is better than terror without end.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the war, the Nazis killed more than 300000 Jews in Poland. You’re not interested in Jews? Then what’s with the Polen nobles that have been shot or left in concentration camps to die? Yes, all young man from Polen nobles, their age ranging from 15 to 20. And the girls all went to brothels. But you probably already know all that, or other crime commited by the Nazis. Why is the German nation so apathetic? It’s still soundly sleeping. Has it already turned so dumb and numb? Every one of us should feel ashamed, when it leaves the Nazis keep doing what they’ve done.”</p>
<p>When they’ve printed out a few hundreds of sheets, Alexander wanted to stop.</p>
<p>but Hans said: “We need more!”</p>
<p>“Why? What should we do with them?”</p>
<p>“We have to go to other cities and distribute them in other universities!”</p>
<p>“In other cities? Do you know how dangerous that is?”</p>
<p>“I’ll do it!” Sophie said. She grabbed the sheets and stuffed them in her bag.</p>
<p>“Those have to go to Hamburg.” Hans said, “”There, a friend of mine is waiting. They want to create a Hambur White Rose.”</p>
<p>“To Hamburg?” Alexander asked, “That’s too dangerous!”</p>
<p>He’s right. The Gestapo are everywhere. It’s dangerous.</p>
<p>“I’m a girl!” She said, “They’re not going to notice me! They’re only looking for soldiers that have run away!”</p>
<p>On the next day she’s already in the train. She already put the backpack somewhere else. Nobody’s going to see it, because the train’s very full. There were policemen everywhere. They asked questions like “Who are you?” and “Where are you going to?” and “What are you doing there?” But none of them saw the backpack.</p>
<p>Sophie met Heinz in Hamburg, a tall, blond German.</p>
<p>She had to laugh all the time when he spoke. She found his accent so strange.</p>
<p>But what he said wasn’t anything to laugh about. He wanted to start distributing flyers with his friends. A Hamburg White Rose!</p>
<p>Sophie is really happy about the trip.</p>
<p>Alexander and Hans too. They went to many cities.</p>
<p>“We’re getting stronger!”</p>
<p>But the next problem came.</p>
<p>They didn’t have any paper.</p>
<p>“And now?”</p>
<p>“They still have some in the university. The professors…”</p>
<p>“What, should we ask?”</p>
<p>“Huber.”</p>
<p>“Ah, he has a family. He’s definitely not going to risk anything.”</p>
<p>“I’m gonna try anyways.”</p>
<p>Alexander visited professor Huber in his house. He’s often there. Sometimes, he has lectures for some interested students.</p>
<p>Huber’s wife opened the door.</p>
<p>“Please come here!”</p>
<p>The professor was still speaking to his little daughter, then he finally had time for Alexander.</p>
<p>Alexander put the flyer on his desk.</p>
<p>“Yes, I read that.”</p>
<p>“We need paper, professor!”</p>
<p>At first, Huber said nothing.</p>
<p>Then: “I can’t do it, Mr Schmorell. That just doesn’t work out. You can leave now.”</p>
<p>“Professor, don’t you want to do something against the Nazis?”</p>
<p>Huber laughed. “With flyers? There’s no point in doing that! You’re risking your lives for absolutely nothing. There’s only one way: The army has to go against Hitler!”</p>
<p>“The army?” Alexander didn’t believe it.</p>
<p>“They’re commiting crime in the east, professor!”</p>
<p>“Our army? No, I don’t believe it either. Or it’s gonna come to an end.”</p>
<p>“Professor: you said to us, we should think independently.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know.”</p>
<p>“Please!”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“Ok then. The day after tomorrow, I’ll bring you a packet. But I want to get in on the next one.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, professor!”</p>
<p>Alexander knew: it’s not easy for a father to do what Huber wants to do now.</p>

        <p><em>A couple of days, flyers can be seen in the lecture hall.</em></p>
<p>The students read them. Sophie too. Then, some put them in their bags, most leave them on the table. It is clear that they have fear. But who could’ve written such a thing? Where can these leaflets possibly come from?</p>
<p>A nation like the German can let themselves be ruled by a group of criminals? Don’t any true Germans have shame? Is the German nation so corrupted that it’s doing nothing? Do we actually have freedom? Are the Germans already without independence, so many without strength and spirit? Then, its journey has come to an end. Goethe said, the Germans are a tragic nation, like the Jews and the Greeks. But today, the Germans are just like sheep, they don’t think individually anymore, but rather let things happen to themselves. But it’s not like that: they finally understood who Hitler is and what he’s anticipating, but it’s too late. Everyone has fear. They know: when they say something, they could end up in prison, or they’ll have to die. Should this go on? Do we want to merely wait and watch, as our young men die in Russia, as our cities are destroyed by bombs?</p>
<p><em>‘And the beautiful word of freedom</em></p>
<p><em>is spoken quietly into the wind</em></p>
<p><em>until one fine day</em></p>
<p><em>we stand at our temple</em></p>
<p><em>rejoicing because we are free again!</em></p>
<p><em>Free! Free!’</em></p>
<p>(Goethe)</p>
<p>Please pass this leaflet on!</p>
<p>After the lecture, Sophie ran quickly back home.</p>
<p>She had to say it to Hans.</p>
<p>There is already a group of students, who no longer have fear. They wrote the leaflet, without doubt. Or professors? No, probably not.</p>
<p>“Hans!” No answer. Where could he have gone to?</p>
<p>Sophie went in his room.</p>
<p>She sat in front of his desk.</p>
<p>Should she return to campus? She still had lectures. But she’s too excited.</p>
<p>There, she read the book, that was laying on the table.</p>
<p>It wasn’t anything about medicine. It was Goethe’s work.</p>
<p>Sophie read out: “And the beautiful word of freedom…”</p>
<p>That’s the same as the text on the flyer!</p>
<p>That…can that be? Did he already know the poem? No, the leaflet was new. Then…Hans wrote it! And he didn’t say a word to her! Of course not: she’s still his little sister!</p>
<p>Sophie waited for him.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Hans returned home.</p>
<p>She was still sitting in front of his desk.</p>
<p>“Sophie?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I’m in!”</p>
<p>“What? Where?”</p>
<p>“I’m in on the next flyer!”</p>
<p>“That…that’s not gonna work. It’s too dangerous!”</p>
<p>“So you think, our women should just stay in the kitchen? Only men can fight! Do you think so?” She went a bit louder. “We’re all in this war, Hans!”</p>
<p>This evening, she came along into the apartment, where Hans met his friends.</p>
<p>Christoph and Alexander were also there.</p>
<p>“I already thought you’d come.” Alexander laughed.</p>
<p>“That’s nothing to laugh about!” Hans is a bit nervous. “It’s dangerous, I…”</p>
<p>“Do you have a name for the group?” Sophie asked.</p>
<p>“It must be something beautiful!” Christoph said. “Something like…”</p>
<p>“Red roses, red lips, red wine?” Alexander asked.</p>
<p>“Ah! Leave it!”</p>
<p>“He’s right.” Sophie said. “Rose is nice. It’s pretty, everyone likes it, but it can prick. It doesn’t need to be red. Red is the color of blood. We’re living in a world of blood. The war…”</p>
<p>“The White Rose?” Hans asked.</p>
<p>“Yes! The White Rose!” Alexander and Christoph said together.</p>
<p>“And the next leaflet comes from the White Rose!”</p>
<p>But the next leaflet had to wait.</p>
<p>Next day, a letter came.</p>
<p>Hans laughed.</p>
<p>Sophie read it.</p>
<p>“The German Wehrmacht!”</p>
<p>“Do you have to…?”</p>
<p>“Yes, fight! In Russia. But…” He looked at his sister. “But only in the lazaretto. And only six months. I already did that for one time in France. In no time I’ll be back and continue studying. So don’t you worry!” He gave her a kiss on the forehead.</p>
<p>The whole Student Corp, that’s the name for it now: also medical students from other grades have to serve for half a year at the front.</p>
<p>Sophie accompanied Hans, Alexander and Christoph to the train station.</p>
<p>Now, she’s all alone in this big city.</p>
<p>Her mother is also alone. Sophie often visited her.</p>
<p>Father went through the trial and had to stay in prison for four months.</p>
<p>But whether in Ulm or in Munich: the war is coming closer.</p>
<p>In the evenings, there are often bomb alarms and she has to go in the bunker under her house. In the streets, Sophie often saw bombed houses and crying people.</p>
<p>And food was running out.</p>
<p>Can this war last on?</p>
<p>The letters from Hans are very short. He has fear.</p>
<p>But the few words he wrote were already scary enough.</p>

        <p><em>Sophie can’t believe it. Tomorrow she’s finally going to university. Tomorrow, her new life will start.</em></p>
<p>She wants to learn biology and philosophy. Her big brother Hans is already there. In his apartment is a free room for her.</p>
<p>Hans picked her up at the train station. A young man is with him. “Alexander Schmorell.” Hans said, “My best friend. He’s Russian.”</p>
<p>Alexander laughed.</p>
<p>“A Russian?”</p>
<p>“My mother is Russian…”</p>
<p>“Then it’s definitely not easy for you at the moment…”</p>
<p>“How’s dad doing?” Hans asked.</p>
<p>“Great! Now he’s healthy again!” Sophie answered, while looking at Alexander. A few months ago, the Gestapo brought his father away. He said something about “this stupid war” in his office and his secretary told the police about it. Two weeks later, he returned home, tired and sick. Can she say all this to Alexander?</p>
<p>“Alexander knows everything.” Hans said.</p>
<p>“Everything? You know, now they’re waiting for the trial. Mom told him to be careful, but he’s still the same.”</p>
<p>“That’s also good.” Hans said. Hans nodded.</p>
<p>Then they went in the city.</p>
<p>Sophie is happy.</p>
<p>The apartment is nice, she likes Munich, and she can finally say everything to her brother and Alexander. But they celebrated first.</p>
<p>She put the cake on top of the table.</p>
<p>“Cake? I haven’t seen such a thing in months!” Alexander said.</p>
<p>It’s wartime. There’s not much in supply. It took a lot of time for mom to find some eggs in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Hans was making tea. After the meal, Hans took out his balalaika and played. Alexander danced russian dances.</p>
<p>And another friend of Hans came. Christoph Probst. But he couldn’t stay long.</p>
<p>“My wife is home alone with our child…” He said to Sophie.</p>
<p>“You’re…married?”</p>
<p>“Yup, he started early!” Hans laughed.</p>
<p>The other three sat late into the night together. They sang and danced.</p>
<p>And they also discussed. Shouldn’t man do anything against Hitler? But what?</p>
<p>“We’re not enough!” Hans said.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so.” Sophie said, “Many people are now against Hitler, but they don’t said it. They have fear. but when someone…” She didn’t go on.</p>
<p>“Are against Hitler? Like dad’s secretary?” Hans laughed.</p>
<p>“Yeah, mom’s friends, the priest, the…”</p>
<p>“Yes, and what? You see, it’s not so many, is it? And most priests find Hitler great!”</p>
<p>“We can write flyers!” Sophie said.</p>
<p>“No. For whom then?” Hans asked, “And that’s way too dangerous.”</p>
<p>They discussed for a long time. But they still didn’t know, what they could do.</p>
<p>Three days later, the lectures began.</p>
<p>“Go to Huber!” Hans had said to her. Huber teaches modern philosophy. The lecture hall is full.</p>
<p>Huber is a tall, thin man with short grey hair.</p>
<p>He didn’t say “Hail Hitler!” when he entered the hall.</p>
<p>“Sapere aude!” He started, “Have the courage to think independently. Have to bravery to know! Our philosopher from Konigsberg said that. Most have no interest in doing that. They are too lazy and too cowardly, Kant wrote. Because, whoever wants to independently think, must have no fear in mind. Then, he doesn’t think about fear.”</p>
<p>Sophie couldn’t believe it. Here, surrounded by countless Nazis, a professor said something like this?</p>
<p>The lecture was almost at an end, the door opened. A group of uniformed students came into the hall. They are from the Nazi student league. They sat in the last row.</p>
<p>Huber saw them. “Punctuality, sirs, is a prussian tradition. That definitely says something about our beloved leader.” Huber smiled. The Nazis were mad. The others laughed.</p>
<p>“And another thing, ladies and gentlemen. People told me, there’s still a copy of a work of Sigmund Freud in the library. Please be careful: don’t read it. It’s not good for your German spirit! And, next time we’ll talk about Spinoza. It’s the most important…”</p>
<p>“A Jew!” One of the Nazis screamed.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Huber smiled.</p>
<p>“That can’t be!” Sophie said to Hans and Alexander at home.</p>
<p>“But it is, that’s Huber!”</p>
<p>“Are there anyone else that have interesting lectures like him?”</p>
<p>“Nope. Only Huber. The others think about nothing, say nothing, want nothing, or better: they only care about their jobs and their wage. The rector is a Nazi head to toe and always runs across campus in his uniform…did you see, how full his hall was?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but a group of Nazis were also there.”</p>
<p>“They always come. They want to terrify Huber. Of course they also want to denounce him. But Huber’s too smart…”</p>
<p>“Sapere aude!” Sophie said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, these guys definitely don’t understand it.”</p>
<p>Many students went to professor Huber. Sophie saw: they’re not alone. Sometimes she talks about the current political situation with other students, but she’s always very careful. She knows: the Gestapo is everywhere.</p>

        <p><em>After the high school graduation exam, Sophie is going to university. But first, she must do mandatory labor for six months. All young Germans must go there. They must help in the countryside or the building of infastructures. The young men are already arriving at the frontlines, where they will do military work.</em></p>
<p>The disciplines are strict. Everyone gets a uniform and a bed in a big hall. They are not allowed to bring books. Every morning, there is a roll call and in the evening a teacher will come, who teaches them the philosophy of life.</p>
<p>Sophie’s group is working in the countryside. The work is tough.</p>
<p>“Think about your fathers and brothers out there on the frontlines! Every German woman must do what she can! You are working for our nation!” Sophie must recite the propaganda of the Nazis several times every day. She doesn’t like to chat with other girls. They don’t understand her.</p>
<p>One morning, when they were making their beds, the other girls were quicker.</p>
<p>Gerda was standing next to her.</p>
<p>“Sophie! Are you still not done? We have to…”</p>
<p>She saw the book that Sophie was holding.</p>
<p>“What do you have there? A book?” She spoke on, but much quieter, “That’s forbidden! What is it then? A romance novel? Can you…”</p>
<p>Sophie didn’t let her rag on.</p>
<p>“No,” She said, “It’s Augustin. Confessions.”</p>
<p>“Augu…what? Isn’t that a saint? You’re definitely a weirdo!”</p>
<p>Sophie just put the book back under the mattress.</p>
<p>Gerda already ran to the breakfast room. “Do you know what she’s reading?” Sophie heard others ask. “The sacred Augustin!” Now everyone is laughing.</p>
<p>“Do you want to become a nun?”</p>
<p>“Or a saint?”</p>
<p>Sophie didn’t answer.</p>
<p>Six months are long, when one feels so alone, but just isn’t.</p>
<p>The girls only have a little free time on weekends.</p>
<p>Others go dancing. Sophie doesn’t, she prefers a walk and some reading.</p>
<p>And this Saturday is the same.</p>
<p>“Sophie, we’re going to the village, to dance! Are you coming along? There are handsome men there!”</p>
<p>“No, I’m tired, I’m staying here!”</p>
<p>“How you like it then!” the others were looking at her. “If you want to be left alone!”</p>
<p>Then they went. Sophie still heard them laughing out loud.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, she’s also ready.</p>
<p>Today when she was working, she saw a small orchestra near here.</p>
<p>She’ll go there.</p>
<p>A small baroque orchestra, standing between two tall trees.</p>
<p>The door is open. Sophie heard an organ playing.</p>
<p>She went in, then up.</p>
<p>In front of the organ sat an old man.</p>
<p>He saw her comming, he looked interested in the book, which she was holding in her hand.</p>
<p>“Augustinus.”, he said and smiled, “without states, there will be no law.”</p>
<p>“And without law no states.” She quoted.</p>
<p>The old man smiled. They understood each other. In this fearful time, it can often happen quickly.</p>
<p>“Can you play?” He asked her.</p>
<p>“Piano, yeah. Am I allowed to try?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I have to go now. You can play. You can come here every evening if you want to. Goodbye.”</p>
<p>“Thank you! Goodbye.”</p>
<p>Sophie sat in front of the organ and tried to play. It was going great.</p>
<p>She sat there for a long time and played. It still went great. Even after months of hard work, Sophie’s fingers were still sharp.</p>
<p>From then on, every free evening she had, she went here and played.</p>
<p>Slowly, her performance improved.</p>
<p>And then, there were only a few weeks left.</p>
<p>But a couple of days, the girls had to attend yet another roll call in the evening.</p>
<p>The commander stood in front of them.</p>
<p>“German girls! Germany needs you! Our men are battling at the front! And you should also play your part. German men and women, together till the end of the war! After the labor, you’ll serve half a year of auxiliary service! You’ll be filled with joy when you help our men during the battles! Our company is going to the east! Hail Hitler!”</p>
<p>“Hail Hitler!” The girls answered.</p>
<p>Then they went into the sleeping hall.</p>
<p>“Another six months!” Some girls were crying. They wanted to go back home.</p>
<p>Others didn’t find it so tragic.</p>
<p>“My boyfriend is in Russia, at the front!” One said, “And he’s not crying. How long he’s going to stay there, nobody knows! And maybe he’s never coming back…”</p>
<p>Others said: “For the commander! For Germany!”</p>
<p>Sophie kept quiet. She couldn’t cry either.</p>
<p>Another six months. But she knew: she’ll manage it.</p>

        <p><em>Sophie still meets with other girls from BDM, just like how Hans still attends Hitler Youth. But now, she doesn’t believe that the Nazis could turn Germany better and stronger.</em></p>
<p>Hans usually goes hiking with his older boy group. They wear Hitler Youth’s uniform, but soon everything is back to how it was. They sing what they want to and say what they think.</p>
<p>“But the old boy groups are forbidden! Don’t you have any fear?” Sophie asked him a few days later.</p>
<p>“Ah, don’t worry too much! We’re all in Hitler Youth. They won’t say anything about that.”</p>
<p>But he made a terrible mistake. One morning, at six o’clock, three men were standing in front of the door. “Gestapo!” They explained quickly and came into the house.</p>
<p>“Does Hans Scholl live here?” Mother didn’t answer. But Hans heard the men and came out of his room. “That’s me. What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“Hail Hitler! We have to take you!”</p>
<p>“But…Why?”</p>
<p>The men didn’t answer. “Don’t fuss. Go, go, change and go with us!” Five minutes later they drove away with Hans.</p>
<p>Sophie is speechless. Mother is crying. Father is making a call.</p>
<p>“What? A big operation?…Ah, understood. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“A big operation against the old boy groups. They arrested young men all across Germany. Not so bad, I think.”</p>
<p>But Hans was imprisoned for a long time. Six months. Sophie wasn’t allowed to visit him. “That’s not for you, little baby”, her mother told her. She was allowed to see her son once a week.</p>
<p>When Hans came home, he no longer went to Hitler Youth. And he seldom went wandering with his friends. And then it was only two or three together. “We have to be careful”, he said.</p>
<p>Sometimes flyers could be found in the postbox.</p>
<p>“Hitler is terrorizing our country!” or “The Nazis must go! They are ruining our country!” Father read these leaflets and threw them in the fireplace.</p>
<p>“Obviously we all know that..and?”</p>
<p>“Dad, what should we do?” Sophie asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know”, is the answer.</p>
<p>In school they didn’t say what they thought anymore.</p>
<p>In history classes they learned why Germany is strong and why Jews are evil.</p>
<p>In German, that Jews are decadent authors.</p>
<p>In French, that Frenchmen have no culture whatsoever.</p>
<p>Now there is a new subject: philosophy of life. There, Sophie learned how to recognize Jews and that disabled people don’t deserve to live. Should she discuss those with her Nazi teacher? There’s no purpose. She didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>Mr Brenzel didn’t come back. Then war came. The number of men seen in the streets are always decreasing. The Germans invaded Poland, they marched across the streets of Paris and Kopenhagen. Many Germans find the victories of German troops amazing.</p>
<p>Sophie still didn’t say anything. She read a lot. Classics. They are not Nazi-related, but also not forbidden.</p>
<p>Church classics. Because the churches today were arranged by the Nazis. She loved Augustinus best.</p>
<p>One afternoon, mom had a visitor.</p>
<p>It’s an old friend of hers. She seldom comes, because she is working in another city, in a clinic for children with mental disorders.</p>
<p>Sophie likes her a lot. But today, she differed from the past.</p>
<p>The two women didn’t go on when Sophie entered the room. And today, mom didn’t want Sophie to sit next to her.</p>
<p>“Don’t you have to finish your homework, Sophie?” She asked.</p>
<p>“No, I already did them.”</p>
<p>“Then please go to the grocery shop. We need bread and milk!”</p>
<p>“I can do that later!”</p>
<p>“Sophie!”</p>
<p>“Ok. I’m going.”</p>
<p>But she stood behind the door. What are they doing?</p>
<p>“And you’ll think, the children…”She heard mom say.</p>
<p>“That’s for sure. They killed them with gas.”</p>
<p>Sophie heard mom’s friend cry.</p>
<p>“All dead. They just murdered them! This…”</p>
<p>Sophie already understood. She also heard about it in school.</p>
<p>“Mongoloid! Schizophrenia! Feeble-minded! They don’t have the right to live under the German ethnic! And when they have children, they must go!” Go?</p>
<p>A few days later, another flyer is in the postbox.</p>
<p>It’s different from the others. It’s a sermon.</p>
<p>Bernhard von Galen, the bishop of Münster, is saying something regarding to the action of Nazis. The actions against the disabled.</p>
<p>“For months, people were taking patients from us in buses. They never came back. After a bit, the family says that the patient is dead, suddenly died. This only means one thing: these patients, these young and olds were murdered! Can a christian accept these things? The government shouldn’t be allowed to do this kind of thing!”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t he have any fear?” Sophie asked.</p>
<p>“Of course, but he’s a bishop, Nazis can’t do a lot about that!”</p>
<p>“And why doesn’t other bishops say anything?”</p>
<p>“Not all of them are like the lion from Münster。”</p>
<p>“But he’s right: no christians can accept what the Nazis are doing.”</p>
